# Blog_Aggregator
This project was created to scrape articles from various websites and send the relevant info to my [personal website's](https://www.funwithbrandt.com/blog-external/) so 
I could have a centralized source to look at when I wanted to know if any of my favorite authors wrote anything knew. It was working beautifully, but unfortunately,
this is not the most up to date code as I did not backup several changes I made before my laptop died. I haven't taken the time to go back and fix everything. This is also why
my personal website hasn't been updated with all of the new articles in awhile.


## To Implement:
* Logging
* Prefect
* refactor add to db methods??
* Change the db to be sotred in a google drive account that can be accessed programatically? Or some other option than csv
* Convert db to postgres?
* Schedule it to run every day
* Validate that the links actually work
* Blogs 
  * Alpha Arhitect: Coming soon, probably,  but I think I need to use selenium.
