Scrape several blogs each week and send out an email if there are new posts on any of the blogs.

* Change the db to be sotred in a google drive account that can be accessed programatically? Or some other option than csv
* Imlement tests to validate that the links actually work.
* Blogs 
  * Alpha Arhitect: Coming soon, probably, but I think I need to use selenium.
