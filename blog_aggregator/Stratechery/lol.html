<p>Circuit Judge Consuelo M. Callahan, in <a href="https://cases.justia.com/federal/appellate-courts/ca9/19-16122/19-16122-2020-08-11.pdf?ts=1597165378">last week’s decision</a> by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, reversing the District Court’s ruling that Qualcomm was guilty of antitrust violations, opened her opinion thusly:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  This case asks us to draw the line between anticompetitive behavior, which is illegal under federal antitrust law, and hypercompetitive behavior, which is not.
</p></blockquote>
<p>This is, admittedly, a distinction I have not seen before, but it is perhaps a useful one, for the simple reason that being a successful business by definition means being anticompetitive: without some sort of differentiation and/or superior cost structure any sort of margin a business has will be competed away, and so preserving that differentiation and/or cost structure — being anticompetitive — should be the goal of any business. The distinction Callahan was drawing, though, is necessary if you interpret “anticompetitive” as being “illegal”: businesses should compete, but they should not break the law along the way.</p>
<p>What makes this distinction particularly challenging is that the question as to what is anticompetitive and what is simply good business changes as a business scales. A small business can generally be as anticompetitive as it wants to be, while a much larger business is much more constrained in how anticompetitively it can act (as a quick aside, for the first part of this essay I am painting in broad strokes as far as questions of specific legality go). The specific case of Apple and the iPhone raises an additional angle: should the importance of the market in the question make a difference as well?</p>
<h4>Apple’s Vertical Integration</h4>
<p>Apple’s business model, which <a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/everything-as-a-service/">uses software to differentiate hardware</a>, is designed to be anticompetitive. The company has traditionally made its money by selling physical devices which run Apple’s proprietary operating systems; its device-manufacturing competitors, meanwhile, have had to rely on an operating system that they could license, primarily Windows for PCs, and Android for mobile devices. They cannot license macOS or iOS.</p>
<p>What is funny about calling this strategy “anticompetitive” is that it wasn’t that long ago that most pundits were sure Apple was anti-competing themselves into the ground. When Stratechery started in 2013, the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-is-being-greedy-2013-9">media was filled</a> with predictions of the iPhone’s imminent demise at the hands of Android: there were simply too many other manufacturers making too many smartphones at too many price points that Apple could not or would not match, which would inevitably lead to developers fleeing iOS and Apple fighting for its life.</p>
<p>The problem with these predictions, as I wrote in <a href="https://stratechery.com/2013/clayton-christensen-got-wrong/">What Clayton Christensen Got Wrong</a>, is that they drastically undervalued the experience of using Apple’s integrated products.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The business buyer, famously, does not care about the user experience. They are not the user, and so items that change how a product feels or that eliminate small annoyances simply don’t make it into their rational decision making process. Again, though, Christensen’s research is tilted towards business buyers. Critically, this includes the PC. For the most of its history, the vast majority of PC purchasers have been businesses, who have bought PCs on speeds, feeds, and ultimately, price…
</p></blockquote>
<p>I attributed Apple’s ability to eliminate many of those small annoyances to its vertical integration, which had long been out of fashion:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The traditional business theory about vertical integration rests on the costs and controls…The issue I have with this analysis of vertical integration…is that the only considered costs are financial. But there are other, more difficult to quantify costs. Modularization incurs costs in the design and experience of using products that cannot be overcome, yet cannot be measured. Business buyers — and the analysts who study them — simply ignore them, but consumers don’t. Some consumers inherently know and value quality, look-and-feel, and attention to detail, and are willing to pay a premium that far exceeds the financial costs of being vertically integrated.
</p></blockquote>
<p>One thing that is worth noting is that Apple has only ever integrated part of its value chain, particularly once it started manufacturing in China. A Mac, for example, looks something like this:</p>
<p><img alt="Apple's integration of software and hardware" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-5226" height="566" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" src="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-1-1024x906.png" srcset="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-1-1024x906.png 1024w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-1-300x265.png 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-1-768x679.png 768w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-1-712x630.png 712w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-1.png 1280w" width="640"/></p>
<p>In this view Apple integrates hardware made with industry-standard components and macOS, providing a platform for even more app developers. Of course, this view of the Mac will soon be obsolete: Apple computers will soon come with Apple’s own chips, which is to say that the company is backward-integrating into one of its most important components. This is, as far as I can tell, seen as a good thing: Apple has both demonstrated its ability to build fast chips and to integrate those chips with its operating system; no one feels especially bad for Intel, particularly since the company had its own near-monopoly for decades.</p>
<h4>App Store Integration</h4>
<p>Of course iPhones have already been using Apple’s own chips for a decade; what has always made the iPhone different than the Mac, though, is the degree to which Apple has forward-integrated into the app ecosystem. What is critical to understand is that this integration proceeded in parts, and that those parts build on each other.</p>
<p><strong>App Store Part One: Installation</strong></p>
<p>Start with app installation: because Apple controls the operating system, it controls what apps can or cannot be installed on the device. iOS will only run apps that have permission from Apple (this permission is ultimately enforced by Apple’s hardware), and Apple grants this permission via the App Store. To put it in the context of the value chain, Apple leverages its integration of hardware and software to control app installation:</p>
<p><img alt="iOS integrated app installation" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-5224" height="566" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" src="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-3-1024x906.png" srcset="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-3-1024x906.png 1024w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-3-300x266.png 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-3-768x680.png 768w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-3-712x630.png 712w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-3.png 1280w" width="640"/></p>
<p>It is essential to note that this forward integration has had huge benefits for everyone involved. While Apple pretends like <a href="https://twitter.com/benthompson/status/1288297750690328576">the Internet never existed as a distribution channel</a>, the truth is it was a channel that wasn’t great for a lot of users: people were scared to install apps, convinced they would mess up their computers, get ripped off, or accidentally install a virus.</p>
<p>The App Store changed all of that: Apple effectively extended the trust it had earned with users over the years to all developers in the App Store. Users could install whatever they wanted, confident the app would not mess up their phone, rip them off, or be a virus. This by extension meant that the addressable market was far larger for app developers than the PC was, even though it would be several years before smartphones had a larger installed base than PCs. And this, of course, brought benefits to Apple:</p>
<div align="center"><div class="video-player" id="v-8FGJ5I8V-1"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="302.0625" src="https://videopress.com/embed/8FGJ5I8V?hd=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1" width="537"></iframe><script src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js"></script></div></div>
<p>This was the combination of integration and modularity at its absolute best: Apple leveraged its control to create a better market that benefited everyone.</p>
<p><strong>App Store Part Two: Payment Processing</strong></p>
<p>Given the fact that Apple controlled app installation, it was a natural extension into payment processing, particularly since the App Store was built on the same infrastructure as iTunes.</p>
<p><img alt="App installation integrated payment processing" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-5223" height="566" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" src="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-4-1024x906.png" srcset="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-4-1024x906.png 1024w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-4-300x265.png 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-4-768x679.png 768w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-4-712x630.png 712w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-4.png 1280w" width="640"/></p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, like iTunes at the time, payment processing functionality was limited to up-front purchases. Suppose you wanted Super Monkey Ball: you had to pay $9.99 to even download the app; there were no trials or in-app purchases:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/10-years-of-app-store-a-timeline-of-changes/"><img alt="The original App Store" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-5222" height="653" sizes="(max-width: 436px) 100vw, 436px" src="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ios-2-app-store-tabs1529860726996-684x1024.png" srcset="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ios-2-app-store-tabs1529860726996-684x1024.png 684w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ios-2-app-store-tabs1529860726996-200x300.png 200w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ios-2-app-store-tabs1529860726996-768x1150.png 768w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ios-2-app-store-tabs1529860726996-421x630.png 421w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ios-2-app-store-tabs1529860726996.png 873w" width="436"/></a></p>
<p>From the beginning Apple kept 30% of every purchase; that was similar to the rate <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB117340340327331757">the company kept for iTunes purchases</a>, and perhaps more pertinently, just barely covered credit card processing fees for a $0.99 app.<div class="bigfoot-footnote__container"> <button alt="See Footnote 1" class="bigfoot-footnote__button" data-bigfoot-footnote="&lt;p&gt;Credit card processing fees generally consist of a fixed fee between $0.25 and $0.30 per transaction, plus 1.5%~3.0%; Apple of course would have had a significant volume discount. &lt;/p&gt;" data-footnote-identifier="1" data-footnote-number="1" id="identifier_0_5217" rel="footnote"> <svg class="bigfoot-footnote__button__circle" preserveaspectratio="xMinYMin" viewbox="0 0 6 6"><circle cx="3" cy="3" fill="white" r="3"></circle></svg> <svg class="bigfoot-footnote__button__circle" preserveaspectratio="xMinYMin" viewbox="0 0 6 6"><circle cx="3" cy="3" fill="white" r="3"></circle></svg> <svg class="bigfoot-footnote__button__circle" preserveaspectratio="xMinYMin" viewbox="0 0 6 6"><circle cx="3" cy="3" fill="white" r="3"></circle></svg> </button></div><a class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link footnote-print-only" data-footnote-backlink-ref="identifier_0_5217" data-footnote-ref="#footnote_0_5217" href="#footnote_0_5217" id="identifier_0_5217" title="Credit card processing fees generally consist of a fixed fee between $0.25 and $0.30 per transaction, plus 1.5%~3.0%; Apple of course would have had a significant volume discount.">1</a></p>
<p>This gets at why this was another great deal for everyone involved: most users had already trusted Apple with their credit card information, and again, Apple was extending that trust to every developer in its App Store, making it far more likely that developers would earn money on their apps than if they had to drive downloads and purchases on their own. And once again, this circled back to Apple’s benefit, both in terms of the ecosystem broadly and, as the App Store reached scale (and added in-app purchasing), real profits.</p>
<p><strong>App Store Part Three: Customer Management</strong></p>
<p>That Apple has controlled app installation and payment processing from the beginning is an obvious point; what is less appreciated is that Apple leveraged its control of payment processing, which was based on its control of app installation, which was based on its control of the operating system, into complete ownership of the customer relationship.</p>
<p><img alt="Payment processing integrated the customer relationship" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-5225" height="566" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" src="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-2-1024x906.png" srcset="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-2-1024x906.png 1024w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-2-300x265.png 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-2-768x679.png 768w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-2-712x630.png 712w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/epicapple2-2.png 1280w" width="640"/></p>
<p>Users didn’t pay developers, they paid Apple, who paid developers. Users didn’t get receipts from developers, they got receipts from Apple, who kept their email addresses for themselves. This did have some user benefits, particularly in terms of ensuring their data was not sold to unscrupulous data brokers, but the benefit to developers was much less clear cut. There remains no means to offer refunds, for example, and for many years developers could not respond to negative reviews in the App Store.</p>
<p>What was most frustrating for developers, though, was that the lack of a customer relationship, in conjunction with the lack of functionality for upgrade pricing, made it difficult to build sustainable businesses in product spaces that did not have an obvious service component (which might require a subscription) or consumables (which could be bought with in-app purchases). The App Store was about transactions, not relationships, and <a href="https://stratechery.com/2013/why-doesnt-apple-enable-sustainable-businesses-on-the-app-store/">Apple liked it that way</a>.</p>
<hr/>
<p>These three distinct integrations, each of which built on the previous, were present in the App Store from Day One — and Steve Jobs knew it. He articulated what just took me 700 words in a crisp five minutes and seven seconds:<div class="bigfoot-footnote__container"> <button alt="See Footnote 2" class="bigfoot-footnote__button" data-bigfoot-footnote="&lt;p&gt;Although I can’t help but note that 2:30 mark has a very rare Apple presentation error: the Backgammon game should be on the iPhone screen &lt;/p&gt;" data-footnote-identifier="2" data-footnote-number="2" id="identifier_1_5217" rel="footnote"> <svg class="bigfoot-footnote__button__circle" preserveaspectratio="xMinYMin" viewbox="0 0 6 6"><circle cx="3" cy="3" fill="white" r="3"></circle></svg> <svg class="bigfoot-footnote__button__circle" preserveaspectratio="xMinYMin" viewbox="0 0 6 6"><circle cx="3" cy="3" fill="white" r="3"></circle></svg> <svg class="bigfoot-footnote__button__circle" preserveaspectratio="xMinYMin" viewbox="0 0 6 6"><circle cx="3" cy="3" fill="white" r="3"></circle></svg> </button></div><a class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link footnote-print-only" data-footnote-backlink-ref="identifier_1_5217" data-footnote-ref="#footnote_1_5217" href="#footnote_1_5217" id="identifier_1_5217" title="Although I can’t help but note that 2:30 mark has a very rare Apple presentation error: the Backgammon game should be on the iPhone screen">2</a></p>
<div align="center"><div class="video-player" id="v-s6wdT7tS-1"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="302.0625" src="https://videopress.com/embed/s6wdT7tS?hd=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1" width="537"></iframe><script src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js"></script></div></div>
<p>Everything about this video was exceptional at the time, and just as critically, nothing was objectionable. After all, the iPhone was still a small business; from a developer perspective, the App Store was (almost) all upside. It would be users who would vote with their wallets in favor of Apple’s approach.</p>
<h4>App Store Problems</h4>
<p>There is a bit of a running joke in tech that the mainstream media believes that every tech company is ridiculously over-valued right up until the day that the exact same company is a juggernaut that is killing industries; in the case of Apple, the company’s strategy was doomed right up until it was illegal, or so it seems with the App Store.</p>
<p>In truth, though, while many of the issues surrounding the App Store are about Apple being a whole lot bigger than they were in 2008, the company has, particularly over the last few years, extended its control further and further away from the core integration that undergirds its business.</p>
<p>Last year, for example, the company required that apps that utilize third-party login services also utilize “Sign in with Apple” (which had to be at the top of the list). This, by extension, meant that cross-platform apps and services had to integrate “Sign in with Apple” into their Android and web apps. This was in part a further assumption of customer management, and also an extension of control beyond the iPhone.</p>
<p>Apple’s control of the customer relationship has also helped sustain its control of payment processing; after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348130/apple-documents-steve-jobs-email-books-amazon-apps-antitrust-investigation-schiller">Amazon advertised that Kindle books were available on all platforms</a> Apple forced the bookseller to stop selling books in its app. Moreover, Amazon couldn’t even <em>tell</em> users to visit Amazon.com, much less offer a link or, <a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/apple-app-store-follow-up-aws-arm-servers-intels-impending-choice/">as Android allows</a>, a webview of the store.</p>
<p>What is troubling about this example, which also applies to Netflix, Spotify, and other so-called “Reader” apps, is that Apple’s aggressive integration up the stack isn’t really helping anyone. Users are confused, these big developers get fewer customers than they might have otherwise, while Apple’s overall iPhone experience is degraded. The ones that really lose out, though, are smaller developers whose cost structures cannot support Apple’s 30% cut, yet don’t have the brand awareness to enable customers to find their websites. In this way Apple is actually making dominant companies even stronger (<a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/platforms-in-an-aggregator-world/">much like they are Facebook</a>).</p>
<p>Apple also appears to be making an effort to limit this exception; while Basecamp managed to drive Apple to a face-saving retreat from its insistence on in-app purchase for its Hey email service, <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/xscale-and-arm-in-the-cloud-hey-versus-apple-apples-iap-campaign/">I heard from many developers</a> that App Store review had started rejecting apps that had been in the store for years because they only allowed users to subscribe on the web.</p>
<p>What was particularly disappointing about these shakedowns, though, is that Apple itself admitted <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/06/apple-reveals-new-developer-technologies-to-foster-the-next-generation-of-apps/">in a press release</a> that it had been holding up bug fixes in App Review “over guideline violations”, many of which were about driving usage of its own payment processor. This is truly an inversion of the win-win-win dynamic that characterized the company’s previous integration efforts: now users were being put at risk for bugs developers were liable for because of arbitrary reasons related to Apple’s drive for Services revenue.</p>
<p>Of course Apple had long put users at risk in other ways; the company had turned a blind eye to <a href="https://stratechery.com/2014/dependent-digital-whales/">the search for digital whales</a> who would spend huge amounts of money on games they could never win. This was, in retrospect, the canary in the coal mine about the corrupting power of the App Store: Apple had started out bragging how they would protect users, but the company seemed far more concerned about protecting its bottom line.</p>
<p>And worst of all, while this was happening, App Store functionality, particularly around payments, was being left in the dust by companies like Stripe, Square, Shopify, and even PayPal. While these companies were making it radically easier for developers to accept payments, offer subscriptions, even get loans and manage their finances, Apple’s payment solution took years to even support subscriptions (never mind that that solution is so difficult to use that <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/news/revenuecat-secures-15m-series-a-for-app-subscription-platform/">a startup just raised $15 million</a> to provide basic tracking functionality); in-app purchase still doesn’t support traditional trials<div class="bigfoot-footnote__container"> <button alt="See Footnote 3" class="bigfoot-footnote__button" data-bigfoot-footnote="&lt;p&gt;You can trial a subscription only &lt;/p&gt;" data-footnote-identifier="3" data-footnote-number="3" id="identifier_2_5217" rel="footnote"> <svg class="bigfoot-footnote__button__circle" preserveaspectratio="xMinYMin" viewbox="0 0 6 6"><circle cx="3" cy="3" fill="white" r="3"></circle></svg> <svg class="bigfoot-footnote__button__circle" preserveaspectratio="xMinYMin" viewbox="0 0 6 6"><circle cx="3" cy="3" fill="white" r="3"></circle></svg> <svg class="bigfoot-footnote__button__circle" preserveaspectratio="xMinYMin" viewbox="0 0 6 6"><circle cx="3" cy="3" fill="white" r="3"></circle></svg> </button></div><a class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link footnote-print-only" data-footnote-backlink-ref="identifier_2_5217" data-footnote-ref="#footnote_2_5217" href="#footnote_2_5217" id="identifier_2_5217" title="You can trial a subscription only">3</a> or upgrades, the importance of which I’ve been writing about <a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/from-products-to-platforms/">for years</a>.</p>
<p>For me this is the biggest disappointment. I have long believed that the Internet is going to <a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/the-internet-and-the-third-estate/">fundamentally remake all aspects of society</a>, including the economy, and that one area of immense promise is small-scale entrepreneurship. The App Store was, at least at the beginning, a wonderful example of this promise; as Jobs noted even the smallest developer could reach every iPhone on earth. Unfortunately, without even a whiff of competition, the App Store has now become a burden for most small developers, who instead of relying on the end-to-end functionality offered by, say, Stripe, have to support at least two payment solutions, the combined functionality of which is limited to the lowest common denominator, i.e. the App Store.</p>
<p>All that noted, what does remain valuable is Apple’s total control of the installation process. The iPhone is probably the most valuable target on earth for scams and hackers, and while <a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/apple-versus-project-zero-apples-poor-response-the-china-paradox/">vulnerabilities have been exploited</a>, there is no denying the fact that users are safer on iOS than they are on other platforms, and that is valuable to everyone involved.</p>
<h4>The Epic Lawsuit</h4>
<p>All of this explains why I find <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367963/epic-fortnite-legal-complaint-apple-ios-app-store-removal-injunctive-relief">Epic’s lawsuit against Apple</a>, which was filed last Thursday after the company updated Fortnite to include an alternate payment system, and was promptly kicked out of the store by Apple, such a bummer.</p>
<p>Epic is attacking every level of the iPhone stack: the company doesn’t just want a direct relationship with customers, and it doesn’t just want to use its own payment processor; it is also demanding the right to run its own App Store. There is precedent on the PC: there Epic has built a rival to Steam that <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3487735/a-year-in-the-epic-games-stores-fight-against-steam-has-made-all-pc-gaming-better.html">has benefited gamers most of all</a>; at the same time, the PC has always been completely open, for better and for worse.</p>
<p>My preferred outcome would see Apple maintaining its control of app installation. I treasure and depend on the openness of PCs and Macs, but I am also relieved that the iPhone is so dependable for those less technically savvy than me. What would be a far better outcome, at least from my perspective, would be Apple remembering that those same users that benefit from the iPhone being locked down should be the focus everywhere.</p>
<p>That means, for example, allowing purchases via webviews, particularly for products and experiences that do not have zero marginal costs. Sure, that could mean less App Store revenue in the short run, but Apple would be well-served having to build more and better products to win developers over. At the end of the day, squeezing businesses that can stomach the cost of Apple development, both in terms of implementing in-app purchase and that 30%, by definition has less ultimate upside than growing the pie for everyone.</p>
<p>This lawsuit is also a reminder that Apple has a lot to lose. While the most likely outcome is an Apple victory — the Supreme Court has been <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/apples-response-to-hey-heys-response-to-apple-heys-limited-antitrust-options/">pretty consistent</a> in holding that companies do not have a “duty to deal” — every decision the company makes that favors only itself, and not society generally, is an invitation to examine just how important the iPhone is to, well, everything.</p>
<p>Indeed, this is the most frustrating aspect of this debate: Apple consistently acts like a company peeved it is not getting its fair share, somehow ignoring the fact it is worth nearly $2 trillion precisely because the iPhone matters more than anything. This is not a console you play on to entertain yourself, or even a PC for work: it is the foundation of modern life, which makes it all the more disappointing that Apple seems to care more about its short term bottom line than it does about the users and developers that used to share in its integration upside; if Apple doesn’t change course, hyperessential will at some point trump hypercompetitive.</p>

<p>The only thing more predictable than members of Congress using hearings to make statements instead of ask questions, and when they do ask questions, usually of the “gotcha” variety, refusing to allow witnesses to answer (even as those witnesses seek to run out the clock), is people watching said hearings and griping about how worthless the whole exercise is.</p>
<p>There was, needless to say, all of the above last Wednesday, when the House Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial, and Administrative Law held a hearing featuring Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon, Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google, and Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Facebook. Statements were made, gotcha questions were asked, answers were interrupted, clocks were run out, and there was a whole lot of griping about what a waste of time it all was.</p>
<p>To be sure, it does seem like there must be a better way to hold these hearings, particularly if the goal is to learn something new, but the reality is that genuine inquiry is much more likely to happen without the glare of the media spotlight that inevitably accompanies such a high profile hearing; what that glare will highlight is the politics of the topic in question: what do various politicians and parties actually care about, what do they think that their constituents care about, and how should those affected by said hearings respond.</p>
<p>In that regard last Wednesday’s hearing was a success: partisan priorities were made clear on the politician side, tech’s collective position and impact on society came into view, even as each of the companies at the hearing revealed different strengths and vulnerabilities. This article will examine all of these points, but first a caveat: this post, even more than most on Stratechery, is meant as an analysis of the politics of this hearing in particular, not a statement of values; unless I say so explicitly, I am not necessarily endorsing or condemning any particular line of argument, simply pointing it out.</p>
<h4>The Political Effects of Monopoly</h4>
<p>Lina Khan, who rose to prominence with her 2017 law review article <a href="https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox">Amazon’s Antitrust Paradox</a>, and who served as counsel for the antitrust subcommittee over the course of the investigation that culminated in Wednesday’s hearings, summarized the <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jeclap/article/9/3/131/4915966">New Brandeis Movement</a> of antitrust in 2018:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  As the name suggests, this new movement traces its intellectual roots to Justice Louis Brandeis, who served on the Supreme Court between 1916 and 1939. Brandeis was a strong proponent of America’s Madisonian traditions—which aim at a democratic distribution of power and opportunity in the political economy. Early in the twentieth century, Brandeis successfully updated America’s antimonopoly regime, along Madisonian lines, for the industrial era, and his philosophy held sway well into the 1970s. As the ‘New Brandeis School’ gains prominence — even prompting two floor speeches by Senator Orrin Hatch (a Republican from Utah) — it’s worth understanding what this vision of antimonopoly does and does not represent.
</p></blockquote>
<p>While the article is worth reading in full, it is no accident that Khan started with “democracy”:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Brandeis and many of his contemporaries feared that concentration of economic power aids the concentration of political power, and that such private power can itself undermine and overwhelm public government. Dominant corporations wield outsized influence over political processes and outcomes, be it through lobbying, financing elections, staffing government, funding research, or establishing systemic importance that they can leverage. They use these strategies to win favorable policies, further entrenching their dominance.</p>
<p>  Brandeis also believed that the structure of our markets and of our economy can determine how much real liberty individuals experiences in their daily lives. Most people’s day-to-day experience of power comes not from interacting with public officials, but through relationships in their economic lives — negotiating pay with an employer, for example, or wrangling the terms of business with a trading partner. Brandeis feared that autocratic structures in the commercial sphere — such as when one or a few private corporations call all the shots — can preclude the experience of liberty, threatening democracy in our civic sphere.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Chairman David Cicilline, in the conclusion to his opening statement, made a clear gesture to the New Brandeis Movement:<div class="bigfoot-footnote__container"> <button alt="See Footnote 1" class="bigfoot-footnote__button" data-bigfoot-footnote="&lt;p&gt;That is Khan sitting behind Cicilline &lt;/p&gt;" data-footnote-identifier="1" data-footnote-number="1" id="identifier_0_5163" rel="footnote"> <svg class="bigfoot-footnote__button__circle" preserveaspectratio="xMinYMin" viewbox="0 0 6 6"><circle cx="3" cy="3" fill="white" r="3"></circle></svg> <svg class="bigfoot-footnote__button__circle" preserveaspectratio="xMinYMin" viewbox="0 0 6 6"><circle cx="3" cy="3" fill="white" r="3"></circle></svg> <svg class="bigfoot-footnote__button__circle" preserveaspectratio="xMinYMin" viewbox="0 0 6 6"><circle cx="3" cy="3" fill="white" r="3"></circle></svg> </button></div><a class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link footnote-print-only" data-footnote-backlink-ref="identifier_0_5163" data-footnote-ref="#footnote_0_5163" href="#footnote_0_5163" id="identifier_0_5163" title="That is Khan sitting behind Cicilline">1</a></p>

<div align="center"><div class="video-player" id="v-zDWTDcpo-1"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="284.0625" src="https://videopress.com/embed/zDWTDcpo?hd=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1" width="505"></iframe><script src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js"></script></div></div>
<p>Because concentrated economic power also leads to concentrated political power, this investigation also goes to the heart of whether we as a people govern ourselves, or whether we let ourselves be governed by private monopolies. American democracy has always been at war against monopoly power. Throughout our history, we’ve recognized that concentrated markets and concentrated political control are incompatible with democratic ideals. When the American people confronted monopolies in the past, be it the railroads or the oil tycoons or AT&amp;T and Microsoft, we took action to ensure no private corporation controls our economy or our democracy.</p></blockquote>
<p>What was notable to me is that in the hearing Cicilline and the other Democrats never really focused on this point; the rest of Cicilline’s opening statement, and much of the Democratic questioning, focused on what they perceived as illegal activities that caused economic harm, without necessarily tying that to political harm. Again, that’s not to say they were ignoring the linkage, but it wasn’t a priority.</p>
<p>What made this stand out was that Republicans were focused almost entirely on the politics of monopoly, specifically their contention that large platforms, particularly Google and Facebook (and Twitter), were censoring conservative viewpoints and working to elect Democratic candidates to office, particularly the presidency, and that this was a problem because of their dominance. Leave aside, if you can, your opinion about the veracity of these complaints (and remember my note at the beginning about focusing on analysis): while the Republicans were certainly not endorsing the “New Brandeis School” — Ranking Member James Sensenbrenner in particular took care to highlight support for the consumer welfare standard, also known as the “Chicago School” — their concern with the size of tech companies had nothing to do with economic effects and everything to do with political effects. It was a striking contrast.</p>
<h4>Begging the Question</h4>
<p>One of the more humorous lines of questioning, at least for language nerds, came courtesy of Republican Representative Matt Gaetz:</p>
<blockquote>
<div align="center"><div class="video-player" id="v-OX8l0Ypj-1"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="284.0625" src="https://videopress.com/embed/OX8l0Ypj?hd=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1" width="505"></iframe><script src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js"></script></div></div>
<p>I want to talk about Search because that’s an area where I know Google has real market dominance. On December 11th, you testified to the Judiciary Committee, and in response to a question from my colleague Zoe Lofgren about Search, you said, “We don’t manually intervene on any particular search result.” But leaked memos obtained by The Daily Caller show that that isn’t true. In fact, those memos were altered December 3rd, just a week before your testimony. And they describe a deceptive news blacklist and a process for developing that blacklist approved by Ben Gomes, who leads Search with your company. And also something called a fringe ranking, which seems to beg the question, who gets to decide what’s fringe?</p>
<p>And in your answer, you said to Ms. Lofgren that there is no manual intervention of search. That was your testimony, but … And now I’m going to cite specifically from this memo from The Daily Caller. It says that the … I’m sorry, that The Daily Caller obtained from your company. It says, “The beginning of the workflow starts when a website is placed on a watch list.” It continues, “This watch list is maintained and stored by Ares with access restricted to policy and enforcement specialists.” Sort of does beg the question who these enforcement specialists are?</p></blockquote>
<p>First off, note that this is an example of Republicans linking dominance to concerns about censorship. The point about language, though, is that Gaetz is using the phrase “begs the question” incorrectly; I know this, because I used to make the same mistake, until a reader graciously corrected me a couple of years ago. What Gaetz meant to say was “raises the question”; “begs the question”, on the other hand, to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Begging_the_question">Wikipedia’s definition</a>, is:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  An informal fallacy that occurs when an argument’s premises assume the truth of the conclusion, instead of supporting it. It is a type of circular reasoning: an argument that requires that the desired conclusion be true. This often occurs in an indirect way such that the fallacy’s presence is hidden, or at least not easily apparent.
</p></blockquote>
<p>For an example of this logical fallacy at work, look no further than this antitrust hearing, and Cicilline’s concluding statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<div align="center"><div class="video-player" id="v-U2zVQGLL-1"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="284.0625" src="https://videopress.com/embed/U2zVQGLL?hd=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1" width="505"></iframe><script src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js"></script></div></div>
<p>Today, we had the opportunity to hear from the decision makers at four of the most powerful companies in the world. This hearing has made one fact clear to me. These companies, as exist today, have monopoly power. Some need to be broken up, all need to be properly regulated and held accountable.</p></blockquote>
<p>If I may nitpick, this is obviously not true — Cicilline had decided well before this hearing that these companies have monopoly power. The problem is that a huge number of questions in the hearing took it as a given that these companies were monopolies, and proceeded to find rather common business practices as being major crimes. In other words, they begged the question.</p>
<p>One of the most striking examples of this fallacy — where it is assumed that a company is a monopoly, and therefore its actions are illegal, and because its actions are illegal it is a monopoly — was this exchange between Representative Jamie Raskin and Bezos:</p>
<div align="center"><div class="video-player" id="v-jhRfu787-1"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="302.0625" src="https://videopress.com/embed/jhRfu787?hd=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1" width="537"></iframe><script src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js"></script></div></div>
<p>Start with the HBO Max-on-Fire TV question. One of the first things you learn about conducting effective negotiations is that you want to negotiate about more things, not fewer. The reasoning is straightforward: if you are only negotiating about a single variable — in this example, Raskin believes that Amazon and HBO should <em>only</em> negotiate on price — the outcome is zero sum: every cent that Amazon wins is a cent that HBO loses. However, if you are able to introduce more variables, then you might find out that one company cares a lot about price, while the other company cares a lot about promotion (just to make up an example); in that case one company can get a better price and give up a lot of promotional opportunities, while the other can get a worse price and gain a lot of promotional opportunities, and thanks to their differing priorities, both feel like winners. That’s good negotiating!</p>
<p>It also appears to be, at least according to Raskin, illegal, because Amazon is “us[ing its] gatekeeper status role in the streaming device market to promote [its] position as a competitor in the video streaming market with respect to content.” That’s the problem though: there was zero evidence provided that Amazon has a monopolistic position in either streaming devices or video streaming; it was simply taken as fact, which made basic negotiating practices suspect, and evidence that Amazon was a monopoly. Begging the question.</p>
<p>Raskin’s question about Amazon’s acquisition of Ring was an even better example of the fallacy at work; while I don’t really understand why multivariate negotiations would be illegal even if you are a monopoly, there are clear antitrust issues raised by a monopolist acquiring a company for market share. Crucially, though, acquiring a company for market share if you are <em>not</em> a monopolist is not a crime.</p>
<p>It follows, then, that if Amazon had a monopoly in the home automation market, and acquired Ring for market share reasons, that could very well be an antitrust violation, but if they weren’t a monopoly, it would not be. What is critical to note is that you have to establish that Amazon has a monopoly <em>first</em>; only then can you decide if the acquisition was anticompetitive. Raskin, though, begs the question: the fact that Amazon acquired Ring for market share reasons is taken as evidence that Amazon has a monopoly, which then makes the acquisition illegal.</p>
<p>The same problem applied to Raskin’s final two complaints: Alexa defaulting to Amazon Prime Music, and recommending Amazon Basics. Those may be a problem if you first establish that Amazon has a monopoly in the relevant product areas, but it is not itself evidence that Amazon is a monopoly.</p>
<p>I’m focusing on this specific exchange, but the truth is that a combination of vilifying common business practices and <em>begging the question</em> was a consistent theme. Things like market research or copying competitor features or improving products were held up as obvious crimes and evidence of monopoly, when they were often not crimes at all, or only crimes if a monopoly in the relevant market had first been established. That is not to say that the committee’s investigation didn’t produce evidence of illegal anticompetitive actions, but rather that said evidence, such that there was, too often begged the question.</p>
<h4>The GOP Bargain</h4>
<p>The combination of the Republicans’ focus on the political aspects of antitrust and the tendency of the Democrats to see antitrust crimes even in normal business proceedings produced what was, I think, the most obvious political takeaway for tech companies: the Democrats have made up their minds (that tech is guilty), while the Republicans are willing to cut a deal.</p>
<p>The outline of that deal could not have been more obvious: Republicans are fine with the consumer welfare standard (which, as I noted back in 2016, <a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/antitrust-and-aggregation/">inherently favors Aggregators</a>) and tech’s business practices, as long as tech companies don’t “censor”; the alternating format of Congressional hearings placed these demands in direct contrast to Democratic assumptions of guilt. To put it in explicit terms: “We, Republicans, are your friends in Washington, but if you want us to defend you from the Democrats, you need to stop censoring conservatives.”</p>
<p>Again, it doesn’t matter that conservative websites tend to do particularly well on social media, or that <a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/the-voters-decide/">the destruction of the media business model helped lay the groundwork for President Trump’s rise</a>; Republicans expect that tech companies — by which they mostly mean Google and Facebook (and Twitter) — err on the side of not censoring or checking conservative content if they want help in Washington, because that help is not coming from the Democrats.</p>
<h4>Tech’s United Front</h4>
<p>Something that stood out from the four CEOs’ <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/28/tech-ceo-antitrust-hearing-opening-statement-385233">opening statements</a>, and the general tenor of their defenses, was their insistence that they supported small-and-medium sized businesses.</p>

<p>20 years ago, we made the decision to invite other sellers to sell in our store, to share the same valuable real estate we’ve spent billions to build, market, and maintain. We believe that combining the strengths of Amazon Store with the vast selection of products offered by third parties would be a better experience for customers, and that the growing pie of revenue and profits would be big enough for all. We were betting that it was not a zero sum game. Fortunately, we were right. There are now, 1.7 million small-and-medium-sized businesses selling on Amazon.</p></blockquote>

<p>One way we contribute is by building helpful products. Research found that free services like search, Gmail, maps, and photos provide thousands of dollars a year in value to the average American. And many are small businesses using our digital tools to grow. Stone Dimensions, a family owned stone company in Pewaukee, Wisconsin uses Google My Business to draw more customers. Gil’s appliances, a family owned appliance store in Bristol, Rhode Island credits Google analytics with helping them reach customers online during the pandemic.

<p>What does motivate us is that timeless drive to build new things that we’re proud to show our users. We focus relentlessly on those innovations, on deepening core principles like privacy and security and on creating new features. In 2008, we introduced a new feature of the iPhone called the App Store launched with 500 apps, which seemed like a lot at the time, the App Store provided a safe and trusted way for users to get more out of their phone. We knew the distribution options for software developers at the time didn’t work well, brick-and-mortar stores charged high fees and have limited reach, physical media like CDs had to be shipped and were hard to update. From the beginning, the App Store was a revolutionary alternative. App Store developers set prices for their apps and never pay for shelf space.<div class="bigfoot-footnote__container"> <button alt="See Footnote 2" class="bigfoot-footnote__button" data-bigfoot-footnote='&lt;p&gt;Yes, Cook is pretending like &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/benthompson/status/1288297750690328576"&gt;the Internet never existed&lt;/a&gt; as a distribution channel &lt;/p&gt;' data-footnote-identifier="2" data-footnote-number="2" id="identifier_1_5163" rel="footnote"> <svg class="bigfoot-footnote__button__circle" preserveaspectratio="xMinYMin" viewbox="0 0 6 6"><circle cx="3" cy="3" fill="white" r="3"></circle></svg> <svg class="bigfoot-footnote__button__circle" preserveaspectratio="xMinYMin" viewbox="0 0 6 6"><circle cx="3" cy="3" fill="white" r="3"></circle></svg> <svg class="bigfoot-footnote__button__circle" preserveaspectratio="xMinYMin" viewbox="0 0 6 6"><circle cx="3" cy="3" fill="white" r="3"></circle></svg> </button></div><a class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link footnote-print-only" data-footnote-backlink-ref="identifier_1_5163" data-footnote-ref="#footnote_1_5163" href="#footnote_1_5163" id="identifier_1_5163" title="Yes, Cook is pretending like the Internet never existed as a distribution channel">2</a></p></blockquote>

<p>This shared focus was notable for two reasons, one specific to these hearings, and one that tells a broader story about how the Internet is changing the world.</p>
<p>First off, probably the most obvious connective thread in the hearing was concern about these companies creating platforms and then favoring themselves unfairly. Amazon, for example, is accused of using data about third party sellers to inform its private-label goods strategy (and data from AWS); Google is accused of using data about search to keep users on its pages; Apple is accused of using its control of the App Store to favor its own apps; and Facebook is accused of using data about app usage to drive its acquisition strategy. What each of these companies is arguing is that focusing on a couple of disgruntled companies is to miss the larger picture, wherein these companies created those opportunities in the first place, and for exponentially more companies than those the Committee may have heard from.</p>
<p>What is particularly interesting, though, is that to the extent these companies are right it foretells both a new kind of economy and a new kind of political alignment. Zuckerberg’s summary was the shortest yet most explicit, perhaps because Facebook is the best example of this phenomenon; I wrote in <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/apple-and-facebook/">Apple and Facebook</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  This explains why the news about large CPG companies boycotting Facebook is, from a financial perspective, simply not a big deal. Unilever’s $11.8 million in U.S. ad spend, to take one example, is replaced with the same automated efficiency that Facebook’s timeline ensures you never run out of content. Moreover, while Facebook loses some top-line revenue — in an auction-based system, less demand corresponds to lower prices — the companies that are the most likely to take advantage of those lower prices are those that would not exist without Facebook, like the direct-to-consumer companies trying to steal customers from massive conglomerates like Unilever.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The Internet is best illustrated by <a href="https://stratechery.com/2014/publishers-smiling-curve/">the smiling curve</a>, in which value flows to large Aggregators and Platforms on one side, and small businesses built with Internet assumptions about addressable markets (and Internet cost structures) on the other side, while the folks in the middle that built their businesses on owning distribution in a world of scarcity are increasingly obsolete.</p>
<blockquote>
<div align="center"><a href="https://stratechery.com/2014/publishers-smiling-curve/"><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-5164" height="449" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" src="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/smilingcurve-1-1024x718.png" srcset="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/smilingcurve-1-1024x718.png 1024w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/smilingcurve-1-300x210.png 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/smilingcurve-1-768x538.png 768w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/smilingcurve-1-899x630.png 899w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/smilingcurve-1.png 1280w" width="640"/></a></div>
</blockquote>
<p>That is why you regularly see strange political bedfellows, like Uber and drivers and riders versus taxi companies and politicians, or Airbnb and hosts versus hotels and, well, politicians, or these companies and their small business bases against newspapers, retailers, cross-platform software businesses, vertical aggregators and yes, politicians. Zuckerberg made this point on behalf of the tech industry as a whole:</p>
<blockquote>
<div align="center"><div class="video-player" id="v-fVmKGjXd-1"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="284.0625" src="https://videopress.com/embed/fVmKGjXd?hd=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1" width="505"></iframe><script src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js"></script></div></div>
<p>We’re here to talk about online platforms, but I think the true nature of competition is much broader. When Google bought YouTube, they could compete against the dominant player in video, which was the cable industry. When Amazon bought Whole Foods, they could compete against Kroger’s and Walmart. When Facebook bought WhatsApp, we could compete against telcos who used to charge 10 cents a text message, but not anymore. Now people can watch video, get groceries delivered, and send private messages for free. That’s competition. New companies are created all the time, all over the world. And history shows that if we don’t keep innovating, someone will replace every company here today.</p></blockquote>
<p>Companies that used to be big, at least before the big tech companies came along, have the most to lose from tech, but just because they are ill-equipped to compete does not mean they are representative of all businesses, particularly companies that only exist because these platforms and Aggregators exist.<div class="bigfoot-footnote__container"> <button alt="See Footnote 3" class="bigfoot-footnote__button" data-bigfoot-footnote='&lt;p&gt;Again, this is not to say that regulation isn’t necessary — see &lt;a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/a-framework-for-regulating-competition-on-the-internet/"&gt;A Framework for Regulating Competition on the Internet&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;' data-footnote-identifier="3" data-footnote-number="3" id="identifier_2_5163" rel="footnote"> <svg class="bigfoot-footnote__button__circle" preserveaspectratio="xMinYMin" viewbox="0 0 6 6"><circle cx="3" cy="3" fill="white" r="3"></circle></svg> <svg class="bigfoot-footnote__button__circle" preserveaspectratio="xMinYMin" viewbox="0 0 6 6"><circle cx="3" cy="3" fill="white" r="3"></circle></svg> <svg class="bigfoot-footnote__button__circle" preserveaspectratio="xMinYMin" viewbox="0 0 6 6"><circle cx="3" cy="3" fill="white" r="3"></circle></svg> </button></div><a class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link footnote-print-only" data-footnote-backlink-ref="identifier_2_5163" data-footnote-ref="#footnote_2_5163" href="#footnote_2_5163" id="identifier_2_5163" title="Again, this is not to say that regulation isn’t necessary — see A Framework for Regulating Competition on the Internet ">3</a></p>
<h4>Tech’s Differing Prospects</h4>
<p>That noted, just because there were similarities in their messaging does not mean that each tech company has similar prospects as far as potential regulation is concerned. From the companies that should be the least concerned to the most:</p>
<p><strong>Apple:</strong> It was obvious that the committee only invited Apple because they wanted to say that they invited all of the large consumer tech CEOs. The questions for Cook were hilariously uninformed about the App Store, making it easy for Apple’s CEO to run out the clock (often without any interruption). This was certainly disappointing given that many of Apple’s policies are <a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/antitrust-the-app-store-and-apple/">clearly anticompetitive</a> (which, as I noted above, is different than being illegal), but for now the takeaway is that Congress doesn’t know and doesn’t care.</p>
<p><strong>Facebook:</strong> Facebook was probably the biggest beneficiary of Democrats <em>not</em> focusing on political harm relative to economic harm; as I noted last year in <a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/tech-and-antitrust/">Tech and Antitrust</a>, there really isn’t much about the company’s business practices (post acquisitions) that are anticompetitive. There was an interesting back-and-forth about Facebook’s discriminatory willingness to deal as far as access to their friend graph is concerned, but for that to be illegal you have to first establish that Facebook is a monopoly.</p>
<p>On this point I thought the Committee’s questioning was frequently unfair: the fact that social networks that existed when Facebook was founded no longer do (MySpace, Friendster, etc.) was taken as evidence that Facebook is a monopoly, with zero acknowledgment of the rise of Snapchat, TikTok, iMessage, etc. Similarly, Facebook’s acquisition of Instagram was discussed as if it happened today, when Instagram has over a billion users, as opposed to 2012, when it had 30 million. To be sure, <a href="https://twitter.com/benthompson/status/189433922243919872">some</a> saw the anticompetitive angle of that purchase at the time, but many more mocked the price; at a minimum we can all agree that judging decisions made in 2012 according to the facts of 2020 isn’t necessarily just.</p>
<p><strong>Amazon:</strong> Amazon seemed to attract the most in-depth scrutiny from the committee (perhaps because of Kahn), and while the biggest focus was on the 3rd-party marketplace and Amazon’s private-label strategy, there was a clear attempt across multiple questioners to make the case that Amazon creates “innovation kill zones”, as Representative Joe Neguse put it, across all of its product lines. There was clearly a target on Bezos.</p>
<p>At the same time, as Bezos regularly noted, it is not clear in what markets Amazon has a monopoly, and if it is not a monopoly, a lot of the behavior lawmakers were objecting to is not illegal (and, as I noted above, may not be illegal regardless). Bezos also made the point that only the military has a higher approval rating than Amazon, and when it comes to politics, that still matters.</p>
<p><strong>Google:</strong> I think that Google is in trouble. The company received the second greatest amount of specificity in its questions as far as competition topics go — Representative Pramila Jayapal’s questions about ad exchanges was particularly well-done, especially given the constraints of the format — but more importantly, at least far as the politics of this hearing is concerned, was revealed to have no friends.</p>
<p>Specifically, the price of the company pulling out of Project Maven and the Pentagon’s JEDI project because of concerns about collaborating with the U.S. military<div class="bigfoot-footnote__container"> <button alt="See Footnote 4" class="bigfoot-footnote__button" data-bigfoot-footnote='&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, I think the real reason that Google pulled out of the JEDI project is that Google Cloud was not competitive with Azure and AWS; citing ethical concerns was a misguided attempt to claim a &lt;a href="https://stratechery.com/2013/strategy-credit/"&gt;strategy credit&lt;/a&gt; that is coming back to bite the company in a major way &lt;/p&gt;' data-footnote-identifier="4" data-footnote-number="4" id="identifier_3_5163" rel="footnote"> <svg class="bigfoot-footnote__button__circle" preserveaspectratio="xMinYMin" viewbox="0 0 6 6"><circle cx="3" cy="3" fill="white" r="3"></circle></svg> <svg class="bigfoot-footnote__button__circle" preserveaspectratio="xMinYMin" viewbox="0 0 6 6"><circle cx="3" cy="3" fill="white" r="3"></circle></svg> <svg class="bigfoot-footnote__button__circle" preserveaspectratio="xMinYMin" viewbox="0 0 6 6"><circle cx="3" cy="3" fill="white" r="3"></circle></svg> </button></div><a class="footnote-link footnote-identifier-link footnote-print-only" data-footnote-backlink-ref="identifier_3_5163" data-footnote-ref="#footnote_3_5163" href="#footnote_3_5163" id="identifier_3_5163" title="Incidentally, I think the real reason that Google pulled out of the JEDI project is that Google Cloud was not competitive with Azure and AWS; citing ethical concerns was a misguided attempt to claim a strategy credit that is coming back to bite the company in a major way">4</a> is that the GOP deal I detailed above is not on the table: Republicans pushed Pichai on not just censorship and election interference but also its refusal to support the military repeatedly, and it seems clear than if and when an antitrust case is brought against the company, it will have few defenders. That is a particularly big problem for Google because <a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/tech-and-antitrust/">the antitrust case against the company is by far the most straightforward</a>.</p>
<hr/>
<p>As I wrote <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/the-antitrust-hearing-the-role-of-congress-ceo-questions/">last week before the hearing</a>, I am glad that it occurred. Figuring out how to regulate tech companies — <a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/a-framework-for-regulating-competition-on-the-internet/">particularly Aggregators</a>, that base their power on consumer welfare — will require new approaches, and probably new laws. Moreover, any such regulations will necessitate difficult trade-offs between competition, privacy, national security, etc. (I was grateful that Representative Kelly Armstrong highlighted how GDPR made big tech companies stronger), which again means that Congress is best situated to decide what tradeoffs we should make.</p>
<p>To that end, I think the hearing was more successful than the format made it seem: there is more clarity about both Democratic and Republican priorities, as well as potential new divisions driven by technology generally, and a finer-grained understanding of how individual companies raise different concerns specifically. No, this wasn’t “Mr. Smith Goes to Washington”, but then again that movie was made by a studio about to be convicted of acting anti-competitively.</p>

<p>One of the more pernicious mistruths surrounding <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/the-tiktok-war/">the debate about TikTok</a> is that this will potentially lead to the splintering of the Internet; this completely erases the history of China’s Great Firewall, started 23 years ago, which effectively cut China off from most Western services. That the U.S. may finally respond in kind is a reflection of reality, not the creation of a new one.</p>
<p>What is new is the increased splintering in the non-China Internet: the U.S. model is still the default for most of the world, but the European Union and India are increasingly pursuing their own paths.</p>
<h4>The U.S. Model</h4>
<p>The U.S. Internet model is a laissez-faire one, and it is hard to argue against its effectiveness. Not only is the technology sector the biggest driver of U.S. economic growth for many years now, but U.S. Internet companies have come to dominate most of the world, conveying U.S. soft power like McDonald’s and Hollywood on steroids. There are obvious downsides to this approach: the Internet’s <a href="https://stratechery.com/2013/friction/">lack of friction</a> both leads to <a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/aggregation-theory/">Aggregators</a> dominating markets and creates communities <a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/a-framework-for-moderation/">both good and bad</a>.</p>
<p>This article, though, is primarily focused on economics and politics, and in that regard the winners and losers of the U.S.’s approach are as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Winners:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Large U.S. tech companies operate freely in the U.S., giving them a large and profitable user base to fund expansion abroad.</li>
<li>New U.S. tech companies face relatively few barriers to entry, particularly in terms of regulation of content or data collection.</li>
<li>The U.S. government collects the vast majority of taxes from these U.S. companies, including from revenue generated abroad, and also sees the overall U.S. view of the world exported via U.S. tech companies, while also having access to the data of non-U.S. citizens.</li>
<li>U.S. citizens operate with a high degree of freedom online, although there are minimal restrictions on the collection of the data generated from doing so by private companies.</li>
<li>Non-U.S. citizens operate with a high degree of freedom online, although there are minimal restrictions on the collection of the data generated from doing so by private companies or the U.S. government.</li>
<li>Non-U.S. companies are free to operate in the United States without restriction, and in other countries that follow the U.S.’s approach.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Losers:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Non-U.S. governments have limited control over U.S. tech companies, limited access to their revenues, and limited control over the spread of information.</li>
</ul>
<p>My biases should be obvious: I definitely believe that the U.S. approach is the best one. Certainly many will quibble with the effect on new companies, given how Aggregators tend to dominate their markets, while others are focused on the collection of data; I am concerned that <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/first-do-no-harm/">proposed solutions</a> are worse <a href="https://stratechery.com/2019/privacy-fundamentalism/">than the harms</a>, particularly given the consumer benefit of <a href="https://stratechery.com/2018/data-factories/">data factories</a>. Still, <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/apple-wins-e-u-tax-case-privacy-shield-struck-down-bans-censorship-and-the-first-amendment/">as I noted yesterday</a>, I believe the European Union Court of Justice makes a compelling case that the ability of the U.S. government to collect data from non-U.S. citizens is a serious privacy issue.</p>
<p>Those quibbles, though, serve to highlight a point we can all agree on: non-U.S. governments have a lot of legitimate complaints about the hegemony of U.S. tech companies.</p>
<h4>The China Model</h4>
<p>The driving impetus of the China model is, first and foremost, control over information. This is evidenced by the fact that not only does China control access to Western services at the network level, but also employs huge numbers of censors for the Internet within China, and expects Chinese Internet companies like Tencent or ByteDance to have thousands of censors of their own.</p>
<p>At the same time, the economic benefit of China’s approach <em>for China</em> can not be denied. China is the only country to rival the U.S. for the sheer size and breadth of its Internet companies, thanks to the combination of a massive market and the lack of competition. Moreover, this led to all sorts of innovation, as China’s leapfrog to mobile avoided the baggage of PC-assumptions that still limits many U.S. companies.</p>
<p>That noted, it is fair to wonder just how replicable the China model is. Smaller countries like Iran have instituted similar controls on U.S. tech companies, but without a market like China it is far more difficult to capture the economic upside of the Great Firewall. And, it should be noted, there are a lot of losers with the China model, including Chinese citizens.</p>
<h4>The European Model</h4>
<p>Europe, through regulations like GDPR and the Copyright Directive, along with last week’s court decision striking down the Privacy Shield framework negotiated by the European Commission and the U.S. International Trade Administration (and a previous decision striking down the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles framework), is splintering off into an Internet of its own.</p>
<p>This Internet, though, feels like the worst of all possible outcomes. On one hand, large U.S. tech companies are winners, at least relative to everyone else: yes, all of the regulatory red tape increases costs (and, for targeted advertising, may reduce revenue), but the impact is far greater on would-be competitors. To put it in allegorical terms, the E.U. is restricting the size of the castle even as it dramatically increases the moat.</p>
<p>E.U. citizens, meanwhile, are likely to see their data increasingly protected from the U.S. government, which is a win; other protections, meanwhile, seem unlikely to be particularly effective or outweigh the general annoyance and loss of relevance that comes from endless permission dialogs and non-targeted content. Moreover, per the previous point, the number of alternatives to established incumbents are likely to decrease, particularly relative to the U.S.</p>
<p>It also seems unlikely that European competitors will fill in the gap. Any company that wishes to achieve scale needs to do so in its home market first, before going abroad, but it seems far more likely that Europe will make the most sense as a secondary market for companies that have done the messy work of iterating on data and achieving product-market fit in markets that are more open to experimentation and impose less of a regulatory burden. Higher costs mean you need a greater expectation of success, which means a proven model, not a speculative one.</p>
<p>Worst of all, at least from the E.U.’s perspective, is that this approach doesn’t really have any upside for European governments. That’s the thing with rule by regulation: without a focus on growth it is harder to create win-win situations.</p>
<h4>The Indian Model</h4>
<p>The India market has always been a bit unique: while foreign companies have usually been unencumbered when it comes to digital goods, leading to a huge number of users for U.S. companies like Google and Facebook, and Chinese companies like TikTok, India has kept a much tighter leash when it comes to the physical layer of tech. This ranges from strong tariffs on electronics to a ban on foreign direct investment in things like e-commerce. Moreover, India has always been one of the most challenging markets in terms of Internet access and logistics.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Indian market is the most enticing in the world for both U.S. and Chinese tech companies, which have largely saturated their home markets. This has led to a regular number of collisions between foreign tech companies and India regulators, whether it be <a href="https://stratechery.com/2016/twitters-earnings-twitter-retrenches-facebook-andreessen-and-india/">Facebook’s attempts to introduce Free Basics</a> or WhatsApp payments, <a href="https://stratechery.com/2017/microsoft-ebay-and-tencent-invest-in-flipkart-the-indian-e-commerce-market-lyft-raises-500-million/">increasing restrictions on Amazon and Flipkart’s e-commerce operations</a>, or most recently, <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/india-bans-chinese-apps-the-app-store-firewall-reddit-and-the-donald/">the outright banning of TikTok</a> on national security concerns.</p>
<p>Over the last few months, though, a way to square this circle has become apparent to U.S. tech companies in particular, and it portends a fourth Internet: invest in Jio Platforms.</p>
<h4>The Jio Bet</h4>
<p>Jio, the dominant telecoms network in India, is one of the all-time greatest examples of the power of building, and the outsized returns that come from betting on technology-enabled disruption. I described the economics of the bet by Mukesh Ambani, India’s richest man, in an <a href="https://stratechery.com/2020/facebook-invests-in-jio-platforms-the-building-of-jio-understanding-the-deal/">April Daily Update</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The key to understanding Ambani’s bet is that while all of the incumbent mobile operators in India were, like mobile operators around the world, companies built on voice calls that layered on data, Jio was built to be a data network — specifically 4G — from the beginning.</p>
<ul>
<li>4G, unlike 2G and 3G, does not support traditional circuit-switched telephony services; voice calls are instead handled the same as any other data.</li>
<li>Because everything is data, 4G networks can be built with commodity hardware in a way that 2G and 3G networks cannot.</li>
<li>Because Jio was offering a data network, voice calls, which are relatively low bandwidth, were the cheapest services to offer, and capacity was effectively infinite.</li>
</ul>
<p>  To put it another way, Jio was a bet on zero marginal costs — or, at a minimum, drastically lower marginal costs than its competitors. This meant that the optimal strategy was — you know what is coming! — to spend a massive amount of money up front and then seek to serve the greatest number of consumers in order to get maximum leverage on that up-front investment.</p>
<p>  That is exactly what Jio did: it spent that $32 billion building a network that covered all of India, launched with an offer for three months of free data and free voice, and once that was up, kept the free voice offering permanently while charging only a couple of bucks for data by the gigabyte. It was the classic Silicon Valley bet: spend money up front, then make it up on volume because of a superior cost structure enabled by the zero-marginal nature of technology.
</p></blockquote>
<p>What makes this story so compelling is the contrast to Facebook’s argument for Free Basics:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The end result is what Zuckerberg said must be done: hundreds of millions of Indians, a huge portion of them from the country’s poorest regions, were connected to the Internet. Unlike Free Basics, though, it was all of the Internet.</p>
<p>  That actually undersells just how much better Jio is for Indians than Free Basics would have ever been: Zuckerberg had no plan for upending India’s old mobile order, where operators focused most of their investment on India’s largest cities and competed for the richest parts of society, charging so much that Andreessen could declare, with a straight face, that to not offer Free Basics was “morally wrong.” In that world, India’s poor may have had access to Facebook, but little more, since there would have been no reason for non-Free Basics companies to invest. Instead they not only have the whole Internet but companies from India to China to the United States competing to serve them.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I wrote that Daily Update on the occasion of Facebook investing $5.7 billion for a 10% stake into Jio Platforms; it turned out that was the first of many investments into Jio:</p>
<ul>
<li>In May, Silver Lake Partners invested $790 million for a 1.15% stake, General Atlantic invested $930 million for a 1.34% stake, and KKR invested $1.6 billion for a 2.32% stake.</li>
<li>In June, the Mubadala and Adia UAE sovereign funds and Saudi Arabia sovereign fund invested $1.3 billion for a 1.85% stake, $800 million for a 1.16% stake, and $1.6 billion for a 2.32% stake, respectively; Silver Lake Partners invested an additional $640 million to up its stake to 2.08%, TPG invested $640 million for a 0.93% stake, and Catterton invested $270 million for a 0.39% stake. In addition, Intel invested $253 million for a 0.39% stake.</li>
<li>In July, Qualcomm invested $97 million for a 0.15% stake, and Google invested $4.7 billion for a 7.7% stake.</li>
</ul>
<p>With that flurry of fundraising Reliance completely paid off the billions of dollars it had borrowed to build out Jio. What is increasingly clear, though, is that the company’s ambitions extend far beyond being a mere telecoms provider.</p>
<h4>Jio’s Vision</h4>
<p>Last Wednesday, after announcing Google’s investment in Jio Platforms at Reliance Industries’ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0b0miKViYg">Annual General Meeting</a>, Ambani said:</p>
<div align="center"><div class="video-player" id="v-lCtjkQDe-1"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="302.0625" src="https://videopress.com/embed/lCtjkQDe?hd=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1" width="537"></iframe><script src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js"></script></div></div>
<blockquote><p>
  I would like to first share with you the philosophy that animates Jio’s current and future initiatives. The digital revolution marks the greatest disruptive transformation in the history of mankind, comparable only to the appearance of human beings with intelligence capability on our planet about 50,000 years ago. It is comparable because man is now beginning to infuse almost limitless intelligence into the world around him.</p>
<p>  We are today at the initial stages of the evolution of an intelligent planet. Unlike in the past this evolution will proceed with a revolutionary speed. Our world will change more unrecognizably in just eight remaining decades of the 21st century, than today’s world has changed from what it was 20 centuries ago. For the first time in history mankind has an opportunity to solve big problems inherited from the past. This will create a world of prosperity, beauty, and happiness for all. India must lead this change to create a better world. For this all our people and all our enterprises have to be enabled and empowered with the necessary technology infrastructure and capabilities. This is Jio’s purpose. This is Jio’s ambition.</p>

<p>  Friends, Jio is now the undisputed leader in India with the largest customer base, the largest share of data and voice traffic, and a world-class next-generation broadband network that covers the length and the breadth of our country…Jio’s vision stands on two solid pillars. One is digital connectivity and the other is digital platforms.
</p></blockquote>
<p>In short, Jio is determined to achieve the dream that has long eluded telecom providers in other countries: moving up the stack from fixed-cost infrastructure to high-margin services. Ambani’s vision is comprehensive:</p>
<p><img alt="Jio's vision slides from Reliance's Annual Global Meeting" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-5138" height="176" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" src="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/jio-8-1024x282.png" srcset="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/jio-8-1024x282.png 1024w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/jio-8-300x83.png 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/jio-8-768x212.png 768w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/jio-8-1200x331.png 1200w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/jio-8.png 1280w" width="640"/></p>
<p>What gives Jio a chance are three important differences from telecom efforts in other markets:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, Jio has created a huge portion of its addressable market; whereas a Verizon in the U.S., or a NTT DoCoMo in Japan was seeking to offer services on top of a competitive telecom market, Jio is the only option for a huge number of Indians (and for those that have options, Jio is so much cheaper because of its IP-based network that it can afford the extra costs).</li>
<li>Second, instead of seeking to usurp companies like Facebook or Google that already have major marketshare in India, Jio is partnering with them.</li>
<li>Third, Jio is positioning itself as an Indian champion, and the lynchpin of the Indian model.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice how Ambani introduced Jio’s 5G plans:</p>
<div align="center"><div class="video-player" id="v-6ZKR8Ngc-1"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="302.0625" src="https://videopress.com/embed/6ZKR8Ngc?hd=1&amp;loop=0&amp;autoPlay=0&amp;permalink=1" width="537"></iframe><script src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/plugins/video/assets/js/next/videopress-iframe.js"></script></div></div>
<blockquote><p>
  Jio’s global scale 4G and fiber network is powered by several core software technologies and components that have been developed by the young Jio engineers right here in India. This capability and know-how that Jio has developed positions Jio on the cutting edge of another exciting frontier: 5G.</p>
<p>  Today friends, I have great pride in announcing that Jio has designed and developed a complete 5G solution from scratch. This will enable us to launch a world-class 5G service in India using 100% homegrown technology and solution. This made in India 5G solution will be ready for trials as soon as 5G spectrum is available, and can be ready for field deployment next year. And because of Jio’s converged all-IP network architecture we can easily upgrade our 4G network to 5G.</p>
<p>  Once Jio’s 5G solution is proven at India-scale, Jio platforms would be well-positioned to be an exporter of 5G solutions to other telecom operators globally as a complete managed service. I dedicate Jio’s 5G solution to our Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi’s highly motivating vision of ‘Atmanirhbhar Bharat’.</p>
<p> <img alt="The &quot;Motivations&quot; slide from Reliance's Annual Global Meeting" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-5126" height="362" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" src="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/jio-5-1024x579.png" srcset="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/jio-5-1024x579.png 1024w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/jio-5-300x170.png 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/jio-5-768x434.png 768w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/jio-5-1114x630.png 1114w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/jio-5.png 1280w" width="640"/></p>
<p>  Friends, Jio Platform is conceived with this vision of developing original captive intellectual property using which we can demonstrate the transformative power of technology across multiple industry ecosystems, first in India, and then confidently offering these Made-in-India solutions to the rest of the world.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Make no mistake: Jio’s network and its work on 5G, which takes years, was by definition not motivated by a phrase Prime Minister Modi first deployed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmanirbhar_Bharat">two months ago</a>. Rather, Ambani’s dedication hinted at the role Jio investors like Facebook and Google are anticipating Jio will play:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jio leverages its investment to become the monopoly provider of telecom services in India.</li>
<li>Jio is now a single point of leverage for the government to both exert control over the Internet, and to collect its share of revenue.</li>
<li>Jio becomes a reliable interface for foreign companies to invest in the Indian market; yes, they will have to share revenue with Jio, but Jio will smooth over the regulatory and infrastructure hurdles that have stymied so many</li>
</ul>
<p>What is fascinating about this approach is that the list of winners and losers gets pretty muddled pretty quickly. On one hand, Jio brought the Internet to hundreds of millions of Indians that would never have had access, and the benefits of that investment are only going to increase as Jio’s services and partnerships come on line. On the other hand, locking in a monopolistic player, particularly in the context of a government that has shown a desire for more control over the flow of information is a real downside.</p>
<p>The economic outcomes are just as muddled. Monopolies always have deadweight loss; then again, if an efficient market means that all of the profits flow to Silicon Valley, why should India particularly care about efficiency? In a Jio-mediated market it is U.S. tech companies that make less than they would have, and not only does India collect more taxes along the way, Jio’s vision of being a national champion abroad could be a huge win for India in the long run.</p>
<h4>The Indian Counterweight</h4>
<p>It is increasingly impossible — or at least irresponsible — to evaluate the tech industry, in particular the largest players, without considering the geopolitical concerns at stake. With that in mind, I welcome Jio’s ambition. Not only is it unreasonable and disrespectful for the U.S. to expect India to be some sort of vassal state technologically speaking, it is actually a good thing to not only have a counterweight to China geographically, but also a counterweight amongst developing countries specifically. Jio is considering problem-spaces that U.S. tech companies are all too often ignorant of, which matters not simply for India but also for much of the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Still, Facebook, Google, Intel, Qualcomm, et al should proceed with their eyes wide-open: they are very much a means to an end for a company and a country that is on its own path. That is not to say these investments are not a good idea — I think they are — but India’s path is perhaps a more populist and nationalistic one than many Americans would prefer. Still, it is less antagonistic to Western liberalism than the Chinese Communist Party, and again, an important counterweight.</p>
<p>The only question left, then, is whither Europe, and frankly, the picture is not pretty:</p>
<p><img alt="The Four Internets" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-5124" height="468" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" src="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/jio-7-1024x749.png" srcset="https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/jio-7-1024x749.png 1024w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/jio-7-300x219.png 300w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/jio-7-768x562.png 768w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/jio-7-862x630.png 862w, https://stratechery.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/jio-7.png 1280w" width="640"/></p>
<p>What differs Europe’s Internet from the U.S., Chinese, or Indian visions is, well, the lack of vision. Doing nothing more than continually saying “no” leads to a pale imitation of the status quo, where money matters more than innovation.</p>
