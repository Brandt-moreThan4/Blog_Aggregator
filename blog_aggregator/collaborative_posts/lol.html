<p>When you’re trying to get wealthy, you think it’s this ridiculously important thing. And then when you make some level of money and you’re “financially independent,” you realize that it does make your life easier. In some ways you have a little bit more access to things and certainly more luxury, but it doesn’t make your life easier as it relates to the great equalizer, which I would call the human condition. So, what is that?</p>
<p>Bill Gates’ mom died. He was a young man. He said that he had all the money in the world, but he couldn’t figure out a way to save her. And so, there’s a great equalizer. We’re born. We die.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Chinese lockdown was more intense than almost anywhere else in the world. Neighborhood committees, the most grassroots level of Communist Party organization, enforced the rules, and in many places they limited households to sending one individual outside every two or three days to buy necessities. If a family were suspected of exposure to the virus, it wasn’t unheard-of for their door to be sealed shut while tests and contact-tracing were being conducted. One student I had taught in the nineties sent a photograph of a door in her community that had been closed with two official stamps. “I haven’t seen such things since I was born, but people who are older must have some memory of such scenes,” she wrote, referring to the Maoist campaigns. “We are becoming numb, which may have more bad impact than the virus, in the long run.”</p>

Because they are making ridiculous money, and it’s mostly rich people that are getting access to that.

<section class="longform drop container container--narrow">
<p>Robert Walter Weir was one of the most popular instructors at West Point in the mid-1800s. Which is odd at a military academy, because he taught painting and drawing.</p>
<p>Weir’s art classes were mandatory at West Point. Art can broaden your perspective, but that wasn’t the point.</p>
<p>Nineteenth-century West Point cadets needed to be good at drawing because cartography was in its infancy. High-quality maps of the United States – let alone, say, Mexico – were scarce, if they existed at all. Military officers were expected to draw maps on the fly and record a battlefield’s topography. It wasn’t a niche; it was vital to war. Weir’s favorite student, who passed the time at West Point drawing river bends and mountain ranges, was Ulysses S. Grant.</p>
<p>West Point <a href="https://www.westpoint.edu/sites/default/files/pdfs/RedBook_GY2020_20170803.pdf" target="_blank">no longer offers</a> drawing or painting classes. Its sole cartography course emphasizes mapping software and technology, as you might expect.</p>
<p>Drawing was an expiring military skill. Critical in one era, diminished in the next, unmentionable thereafter.</p>
<p>A lot of things work that way.</p>
<p>Every field has two kinds of skills:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Expiring skills</strong>, which are vital at a given time but prone to diminishing as technology improves and a field evolves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Permanent skills</strong>, which were as essential 100 years ago as they are today, and will still be 100 years from now.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Both are important. But they’re treated differently.</p>
<p>Expiring skills tend to get more attention. They’re more likely to be the cool new thing, and a key driver of an industry’s short-term performance. They’re what employers value and employees flaunt.</p>
<p>Permanent skills are different. They’ve been around a long time, which makes them look stale and basic. They can be hard to define and quantify, which gives the impression of fortune-cookie wisdom vs. a hard skill.</p>
<p>But permanent skills compound over time, which gives them quiet importance. When several previous generations have worked on a skill that’s directly relevant to you, you have a deep well of relevant examples to study. And when you can spend a lifetime perfecting one skill whose importance never wanes, the payoffs can be ridiculous. Anything that <a href="https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/the-psychology-of-money/" target="_blank">compounds over decades</a> usually is.</p>
<p>A few permanent skills that apply to many fields:</p>
<p><strong>Not being a jerk</strong>. Being a jerk offsets being talented one for one, if not more. They don’t teach this in school, but it’s the single most important career skill. Part of this includes empathizing with jerks who are being jerks because they’re dealing with stress.</p>
<p><strong>The willingness to adapt views you wish were permanent.</strong> Accepting when expiring skills have run their course. A lot of what we believe about our fields is either right but temporary, or wrong but convincing. Sam Arbesman’s book <em><a href="https://amzn.to/3kFMG2b" target="_blank">The Half-Life of Facts</a></em> makes this uncomfortably clear. “Medical knowledge about cirrhosis or hepatitis takes about forty-five years for half of it to be disproven or become out-of-date,” he writes. “This is about twice the half-life of the actual radioisotope samarium-151.”</p>
<p><strong>Getting along with people you disagree with.</strong> Equally smart people can come to different conclusions. And as Larry Summers once noted, “There are idiots; look around.” Some of these people can be avoided. Many can’t. You have to deal with them diplomatically. People who view every disagreement as a battle that must be won before moving on end up stuck and bitter.</p>
<p><strong>Getting to the point</strong>. Everyone’s busy. Make your point and get out of their way.</p>
<p><strong>Respecting luck as much as you respect risk.</strong> Acknowledging risk is when something happens outside of your control that influences outcomes and you realize it might happen again. Acknowledging luck is when something happens outside of our control that influences outcomes and you realize it might not happen again.</p>
<p><strong>Staying out of the way as much as you offer to help</strong>. You can add as much value by getting out of people’s way and minimizing your burden as you can by actively helping. This is especially important for two groups: new employees eager to get involved, and senior managers eager to get involved.</p>
<p><strong>Accepting a certain degree of hassle and nonsense when reality demands it</strong>. The ability to be comfortable being miserable. Frances Perkins, Franklin Roosevelt’s Secretary of Labor, said the most remarkable thing about the president’s paralysis was how little it seemed to bother him. He told her: “If you can’t use your legs and they bring you milk when you wanted orange juice, you learn to say ‘that’s all right,’ and drink it.” A useful and permanent skill in a world that’s constantly breaking and evolving.</p>
<p><strong>The ability to distinguish “temporarily out of favor” from “wrong.”</strong> Endurance is key because every industry is cyclical, and putting up with its dark days is the only way to ensure you’re part of the good ones. <a href="https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/humble-exits/" target="_blank">Gracefully exiting</a> when you realize that whatever fueled past success doesn’t work anymore is also key. Warren Buffett says his favorite holding period is forever, then dumped $7 billion worth of airline stocks based on a few weeks of data. That might look like a contradiction, but it’s likely an example of being always patient but never stubborn.</p>
<p>Those never get old.</p>

<section class="longform drop container container--narrow">
<p>I grew up ski racing in Lake Tahoe. I was on the Squaw Valley Ski Team, and it was the center of my life for over a decade.</p>
<p>At a conference a few months ago I was asked what skiing taught me about investing. This was on stage, where you can’t ponder your answer – you have to blurt out whatever you can think of.</p>
<p>I didn’t think skiing taught me anything about investing. But one incident came to mind.</p>
<p>“Well, let me take this to a dark and tragic place,” I said before telling a group of 500 strangers a story I hadn’t talked about much in almost 20 years.</p>
<hr/>
<p>A dozen of us had grown up skiing together. Most had known each other since we were young children.</p>
<p>By 2001 we were in our late teens, having spent the majority of our waking hours over the previous decade never far from each other. We skied six days a week, 10 months a year, spending summers on the glacier of Mt. Hood, Oregon and in New Zealand, where the seasons mirror our own. Skiing took precedence to everything. Most of us were in an independent study program that let us bypass traditional high school. After skiing all day we read a few books and filled out a few forms in the evening in what – to our amazement – led to a diploma.</p>
<p>The amount of time we spent together created a relationship closer to siblings than friends. Ski racing is an odd hybrid between a team and individual sport. You train and travel and eat as a team, but the sport itself is individual. Our race results did not rely on each other; our daily sanity did.</p>
<p>Any group of a dozen teenagers will find a way to butt heads. Half the time I think we hated each other. Twenty years later, few of us keep in touch.</p>
<p>But of the dozen teenagers who, by 2001, I had spent the majority of my life with, four of us had become inseparable best friends.</p>
<p>This is the story of two of them – Brendan Allan and Bryan Richmond.</p>
<hr/>
<p>You take amazing things for granted when they become routine. Squaw Valley is one of the largest ski resorts in North America, was home to the 1960 Olympics, and attracts a million visitors a year. It’s staggeringly beautiful. To us, it was just an extension of home.</p>
<p>Ski racing required four hours a day of training, which felt like work to us. The rest of the time – another four hours a day, six days a week – we just skied around, unstructured, having a good time. We called it “free skiing.” Everyone else just calls it skiing.</p>
<p>On February 15th, 2001, we had just returned from a race in Colorado. Our flight home was delayed because Lake Tahoe was blasted with a blizzard vicious even by its own standards. You can’t race or train when there’s a blanket of new snow – racing requires hard-packed ice. So it was time for a week of free skiing.</p>
<p>Earlier that month Tahoe received several feet of light, fluffy snow that comes from Arctic temperatures. The storm that hit in mid-February was different. It was warm – barely at the freezing point – and powerful, leaving three feet of heavy, wet snow on top of the light powder that came before it.</p>
<p>We didn’t think about it at the time – we didn’t think about much at age 17 – but the combination of heavy snow on top of fluffy snow creates textbook perfect avalanche conditions.</p>
<p>Imagine a thick layer of sand with a layer of heavy cement on top. Now imagine putting those layers on a steep hill. It’s fragile, prone to sliding down. That’s what Squaw Valley was like in late February 2001.</p>
<p>Ski resorts are good at managing these kinds of conditions to keep people safe. Few tourists realize it, but if you visit a ski resort in the early morning hours after a blizzard you will hear what sounds like bombs going off. The sound isn’t deceiving. With a combination of mortars, grenades, and charges dropped from helicopters, ski patrol do controlled blasts of at-risk pitches to intentionally trigger avalanches when the resort is empty, preempting slides before guests arrive (check out some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-eQVY_KHR0A" target="_blank">videos</a>).</p>
<p>It’s an effective system, keeping avalanche accidents at major resorts rare.</p>
<p>But if you’re skiing out of bounds – ducking under the DO NOT CROSS ropes to ski the forbidden terrain untouched by masses of Bay Area tourists – the system won’t help you.</p>
<p>Skiing out of bounds is illegal, a form of trespassing. The main reason resorts don’t want you doing it is because it’s dangerous.</p>
<p>Out-of-bounds areas aren’t patrolled, so you’re on your own if you get injured. They usually don’t lead down to a chairlift, so you have to find your own way back up.</p>
<p>And they’re not bombed for avalanche control. So it’s here – out of bounds – that a skier is most likely to discover Mother Nature’s sliding wrath.</p>
<p>On the morning of February 21st, 2001, Brendan, Bryan, and I met in the Squaw Valley Ski Team locker room, like we had hundreds of times before. Bryan’s mom told me years later that his last words when he left his house that morning were, “Don’t worry, Mom, I won’t ski out of bounds.”</p>
<p>But as soon as we clicked into our skis, that’s what the three of us did.</p>
<hr/>
<p>The backside of Squaw Valley, behind the KT-22 chairlift, is a stretch of mountain about a mile long that separates Squaw from Alpine Meadows ski resort.</p>
<p>It’s good skiing – steep, wide open, with rolling terrain. And since it’s out of bounds, it was completely untouched. Our private playground.</p>
<p>Before February 21st I had skied it maybe a dozen times. It wasn’t one of our frequent spots, because it’s a pain in the ass. The end of Squaw’s backside spits you out on a back country road, where we would hitchhike back to our locker room.</p>
<p>Brendan, Bryan, and I decided to ski it that morning.</p>
<p>When an event becomes life-changing, all kinds of mundane details sear into your memory. Almost 20 years later I remember Brendan duct-taping his ski pants shut on the chairlift because I had broken the side zipper while wearing them the week before. I remember Bryan cackling with joy as the three of us entered barren wilderness while the rest of the resort was packed with crowds.</p>
<p>And I vividly remember getting hit by one of the only avalanches I’ve ever experienced.</p>
<p>It was tiny, not going over my knees. It wasn’t scary. I remember laughing. But the feeling is unforgettable. I didn’t hear or see the slide. I just suddenly realized my skis weren’t on the ground anymore – I was literally floating in a cloud of snow. You have no control in these situations, because rather than pushing back on the snow to gain traction with your skis, the snow is pushing you. The best you can do is keep your balance to remain upright. I remember putting my hands up and shouting, “Wahooo” like I was on a roller coaster. I essentially was.</p>
<p>The avalanche ended quickly. Brendan was to my left and Bryan was below us. No one stopped. We just charged to the bottom.</p>
<p>“Holy shit, did you see that avalanche?” I remember saying when we got to the road.</p>
<p>“Haha, that was awesome.” Brendan said. No one thought much more of it.</p>
<p>We hitchhiked back. At first we had trouble getting a car to pick us up, so I decided if we took our shirts off in the 20-degree weather people would have sympathy for us and stop. It actually worked. Seventeen-year-old boys are resourceful.</p>
<hr/>
<p>When we got back to Squaw Brendan and Bryan said they wanted to ski the backside again.</p>
<p>I have no recollection of why, or how this came about, but I didn’t want to go.</p>
<p>It may have been the hitchhiking, which I always hated. That, more than the out-of-bounds skiing, felt reckless to me.</p>
<p>But I had an idea. Brendan and Bryan could ski the backside themselves. Rather than hitchhiking back, I would pick them up in my truck.</p>
<p>Everyone agreed on the plan, which we made in the Wildflour Baking Company cookie shop in the Squaw Valley lodge after lunch. This was before we had cell phones, so syncing on concrete plans ahead of time was important.</p>
<p>Brendan and Bryan walked out and skied off.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Thirty minutes after Brendan and Bryan took the chair up to ski the backside, I drove to the back-country road where I was scheduled to pick them up.</p>
<p>They weren’t there.</p>
<p>I waited another 30 minutes before giving up. It took maybe five minutes to ski the pitch, so I knew they weren’t coming. It didn’t occur to me that they were in danger. I figured they beat me to the bottom and hitchhiked back.</p>
<p>I drove back to our locker room, expecting to find them. They weren’t there, either. I asked around. No one had seen them.</p>
<p>I drove to Brendan’s house, which wasn’t far from the pick-up point. No one was home. I drove back to the locker room and called his house. It went to voicemail. I remember ending the message with, “I hope you’re OK man.”</p>
<p>I was starting to get nervous, but not enough to make a big deal. People were more comfortable being out of touch before the texting era.</p>
<p>Later that day, around 4 pm, Bryan’s mom called me at home. I remember every word.</p>
<p>“Hi Morgan, Bryan didn’t show up for work. Do you know where he is?” she asked.</p>
<p>I told her the truth. “We skied the backside of KT-22 this morning. He and Brendan did it again, I was going to pick them up on the road. But they weren’t there, and I haven’t seen them since.”</p>
<p>“Oh my God,” she said. Click.</p>
<p>I think in that moment she pieced together what may have happened to her son. I did, too.</p>
<p>Later that evening, after sunset, my friend Ahren and I bought heavy duty flashlights at a drug store and drove to the pick-up spot. We shined the lights up the mountain shouting, “Brennnndan …. Bryyyyyan.” I remember Ahren and I thinking they had likely broken their legs and were stuck on the hill. In the back of my mind I knew it was more serious, but it was comforting to think we could find them.</p>
<p>We gave up quickly and drove to the locker room.</p>
<p>I forget who made the call, but the police were suddenly taking our information in what had become a missing-person report.</p>
<p>I don’t fault the police for this, but they didn’t take it seriously. I remember one saying, “99% of the time in cases like these the person is out drunk at a party, or ran off with a girl for the night.” I’m sure he was right – that was usually the case. But I knew he was wrong.</p>
<p>“Their shoes are right there,” I said, pointing to Brendan and Bryan’s sneakers on the locker room floor. “That means their ski boots are on their feet. And it’s now 9 pm. Think about that. It’s 9 pm and they have their ski boots on their feet. They are not at a party.”</p>
<p>Around 10 pm I was told to go to the Squaw Valley Fire Department where I met the local search and rescue team. They took it much more seriously.</p>
<p>I explained everything Brendan, Bryan, and I did that day. The search team pulled out maps, and I showed them exactly where we entered the out-of-bounds area, where we exited, and the path we took. I told them about the small avalanche we were caught in that morning. As soon as I mentioned it I could see the dots connecting in the rescuers’ heads. These were seasoned professionals who understood the danger of mountains. When I finished talking I remember two of the rescuers looked at each other and sighed. They knew.</p>
<p>I drove back to the locker room around midnight. The Squaw Valley parking lot can hold several thousand cars. By this time it was almost empty. Everyone had gone home, except two cars parked next to each other: Brendan’s Jeep, and Bryan’s Chevy pickup.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Search and rescue teams were on the backside of Squaw a little after midnight. It was still a blizzard, with gusty winds and low visibility even during daylight. I remember watching them ski off in the pitchblack night.</p>
<p>With giant floodlights and a team of search dogs, they went looking for Brendan and Bryan.</p>
<p>I later learned that as soon as the rescue team entered the out-of-bounds point where I told them we skied, they found the fresh scars of a massive avalanche field.</p>
<p>I tried to sleep on a bench in the locker room, but couldn’t shut my eyes. I remember hoping Brendan and Bryan would come bounding through the door. The hours dragged on, and felt like days.</p>
<p>By 9 am the locker room was packed with other ski racers, parents, friends, and family, all eager to help. It became a staging area for the search.</p>
<p>I laid back down on the bench and finally fell asleep. A few minutes later I awoke to the sound of a scream, followed by yelling and commotion.</p>
<p>I knew what happened. No one needed to say it.</p>
<p>I walked to the second floor of the locker room where I saw Bryan’s mom on a couch. The scream was hers. “I’m so sorry,” I told her, bawling. It’s hard to describe a moment like that. I didn’t know what else to say then. I don’t know what else to say now.</p>
<p>Search dogs had honed in on a spot in the avalanche field where rescuers with probe poles found Brendan and Bryan buried under six feet of snow.</p>
<p>They were born one day apart, and died 10 feet from each other.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Later that day I drove to see my dad at work. I wanted to be around family. He met me in the parking lot and said, “I’ve never been so happy to see you.” It was the only time I’ve seen him cry.</p>
<p>It didn’t occur to me until that moment how close I was to going with Brendan and Bryan.</p>
<p>Why did I ski the backside with them once that morning, but then decline a second run?</p>
<p>I’ve thought about it a million times. I have no idea.</p>
<p>Why was the avalanche on our first run a tiny little thrill, but the second run triggered a massive slide that killed two 17-year-olds?</p>
<p>We’ll never know.</p>
<p>The next evening, Tom Brokaw told Brendan and Bryan’s story on the NBC Nightly News. It was surreal to watch. We were laughing together 36 hours before. Now their death was national news. And the only thing that kept me from being a third name in the newscast I had watched religiously was a fluke decision I put no thought into.</p>
<p>It’s been almost 20 years since this happened. Sometimes I think about everything that’s occurred since – college, marriage, career, kids – and remind myself that I’ve only experienced it because of a blind, thoughtless decision to decline another ski run.</p>
<p>This story isn’t unique. Many people reading this have had near-death experiences. Most have lost someone dear to them. And everyone reading this has made what seemed like know-nothing, inconsequential decisions that fundamentally reshaped their lives. Sometimes those fluke decisions are positive. Sometimes they’re negative. But they’re always out of the blue, unforeseeable. It’s just how life works.</p>
<hr/>
<p>After I told this story at the conference I had to tie it back to an investing lesson. It was easier than I thought.</p>
<p>My risk tolerance plunged after Brendan and Bryan died. I broke my back skiing (no nerve damage) a few months later, which crushed it even more. I haven’t skied much since. Maybe ten times in the last 15 years. If I’m honest, it scares me.</p>
<p>I’ve been risk-averse in other areas of life ever since, too. I drive the speed limit. I obey the seatbelt sign on airplanes. I invest in index funds.</p>
<p>I don’t know if Brendan and Bryan’s death actually affected how I invest. But it opened my eyes to the idea that there are three distinct sides of risk:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The odds you will get hit.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The average consequences of getting hit.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The tail-end consequences of getting hit.</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The first two are easy to grasp. It’s the third that’s hardest to learn, and can often only be learned through experience.</p>
<p>We knew we were taking risks when we skied. We knew that going out of bounds was wrong, and that we might get caught. But at 17 years old we figured the consequences of risk meant our coaches might yell at us. Maybe we’d get our season pass revoked for the year.</p>
<p>Never, not once, did we think we’d pay the ultimate price.</p>
<p>But once you go through something like that, you realize that the tail-end consequences – the low-probability, high-impact events – are all that matter.</p>
<p>In investing, the average consequences of risk make up most of the daily news headlines. But the tail-end consequences of risk – like pandemics, and depressions – are what make the pages of history books. <em>They’re all that matter</em>. They’re all you should focus on. We spent the last decade debating whether economic risk meant the Federal Reserve set interest rates at 0.25% or 0.5%. Then 36 million people lost their jobs in two months because of a virus. It’s absurd.</p>
<p>Tail-end events are all that matter.</p>
<p>Once you experience it, you’ll never think otherwise.</p>

<section class="longform drop container container--narrow">
<p>Three days after Ronald Reagan was inaugurated in 1981, New York City Council President Carol Bellamy joined a group of speakers at a luncheon to discuss the country’s future.</p>
<p>The group tried to make sense of a world that was hardly recognizable from a generation before. Crime, inflation, and unemployment were surging. Speakers offered visions of what might happen next.</p>
<p>Bellamy said they were all misguided.</p>
<p>No one was discussing “where we’ve been, and until we know that, it’s difficult to figure out where we’re heading,” she said, according to the <em>New York Times</em>.</p>
<p>This article is about how that idea applies to 2020.</p>
<p>Everyone is innocently short-sighted when trying to make sense of 2020.</p>
<p>January, before Covid-19 upended everything, feels like a different lifetime. March is already a blur. Time slows when you <a href="https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/why-time-has-slowed/" target="_blank">experience surprise</a>, and every day of 2020 brings a new shock. So the recent past feels like distant history.</p>
<p>But if you survey the confusing mess we’re in – 50 million jobs lost, 130,000 dead, Tesla stock up 400% – you have to remember that none of it happened in a vacuum. Every event has parents, grandparents, siblings, and cousins – previous events that planted the seeds, passed on their DNA, and continue to influence what’s happening today.</p>
<p>To have any hope of making sense of what’s happening in 2020, we have to pay attention to a bunch of seemingly unrelated stories that began before anyone had heard of Covid-19.</p>
<p>Here are five that seem particularly important.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>1. People grew apart financially at the same time they became connected digitally, which exacerbates</strong> <strong>tribal instincts and</strong> <strong>exposes you to people who don’t see the world as you do, who become easy targets for criticism and blame.</strong></p>
<p>To understand why so many people are so angry in 2020 you have to realize that half the country gained insight into the other half at the very moment those halves were as different economically as they’ve ever been.</p>
<p>Here’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/08/07/opinion/leonhardt-income-inequality.html" target="_blank">one side of the equation</a>:</p>
<p><figure class="post__figure"><img alt="Sorry Brandt screwed up this image somehow." class="img-fluid" src="https://www.collaborativefund.com/uploads/1-fd12b9.png"/></figure></p>
<p>And <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/internet#growth-of-the-internet" target="_blank">the other:</a></p>
<p><figure class="post__figure"><img alt="Sorry Brandt screwed up this image somehow." class="img-fluid" src="https://www.collaborativefund.com/uploads/2-da7cc3.png"/></figure></p>
<p>These well-known stories are usually viewed in isolation. It’s how they interact with each other that I find interesting.</p>
<p>There are a few parts to it:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>People gauge their wellbeing relative to those around them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Historically, the people around you <a href="https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/three-big-things-the-most-important-forces-shaping-the-world/" target="_blank">were relatively similar to you</a>. They lived in the same city, went to the same schools, worked at the same factories, and earned similar wages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The internet and social media increased the number of people “around you” exponentially.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It happened at the same time the economic distance between people ballooned.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s important, because when you’re exposed to people who are experiencing a different world than you are it becomes easy to ask, “Why don’t I have what they have?” on one end and, “Why don’t they have what I have?” on the other. Or just, <em>“Why are you not like me?”</em></p>
<p>People have always asked that question. But the range of answers isn’t wide if the pool of people you judge yourself against is constrained to the town you live in or the company you work for. Once it’s expanded to 2.6 billion people commenting on Facebook posts, or a curated feed of Instagram vacation photos from Dubai and the Maldives, you enter a different world.</p>
<p>It pours gasoline on the flame of two things.</p>
<p>One is that the lifestyle of legitimately wealthy people <a href="https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/how-this-all-happened/" target="_blank">inflates the aspirations of lower-income families, pushing them towards funding an equivalent lifestyle that can only be achieved with ever-growing amounts of debt</a>. This is true for everything from houses to cars to college degrees.</p>
<p>Another is that people whose lives have taken different paths will have different views on everything from politics to cultural norms. When those groups are then exposed to each other, it can be hard to distinguish a differing view from a threatening view. Disagreements ensue, embolden by the anonymity and detached nature of social media. TechCrunch founder Michael Arrington <a href="https://twitter.com/arrington/status/1179261775100993536?s=20" target="_blank">recently </a>wrote: “I thought Twitter was driving us apart, but I’m slowly starting to think half of you always hated the other half but never knew it until Twitter.”</p>
<p>Harper’s Magazine wrote in 1957 about the leveling forces of the prosperous middle class:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The rich man smokes the same sort of cigarettes as the poor man, shaves with the same sort of razor, uses the same sort of telephone, vacuum cleaner, radio, and TV set, has the same sort of lighting and heating equipment in his house, and so on indefinitely. The differences between his automobile and the poor man’s are minor. Essentially they have similar engines, similar fittings. In the early years of the century there was a hierarchy of automobiles.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s interesting to ask: what would social media be like in that era compared to this one?</p>
<p>It would lead to disagreement. But with the same fervor as today? Probably not.</p>
<p>It would be nasty. But as nasty as today? Probably not.</p>
<p>But we have it today. So here we are.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>2. A century-long shift away from labor-intensive jobs towards creative-thinking jobs creates a stark contrast between jobs that can be done during a pandemic and jobs that can’t.</strong></p>
<p>For most of history people worked with their arms, legs, and backs. They labored.</p>
<p>The machines came along and more people started working with their hands, operating equipment in factories.</p>
<p>Then computers came along and more people started working with their brains, doing creative and service jobs.</p>
<p>It isn’t a subtle shift. It’s been a complete remake of the economy in modern times:</p>
<p><figure class="post__figure"><img alt="Sorry Brandt screwed up this image somehow." class="img-fluid" src="https://www.collaborativefund.com/uploads/3-4406d3.png"/></figure></p>
<p class="caption"><em>Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics, The Rise and Fall of American Growth.</em></p>
<p>It’s an important shift for many reasons.</p>
<p>For most of the 20th Century the idea of working from home was not an option. People worked in factories and shops, and there was no alternative because working meant doing something with your muscles, usually around other people.</p>
<p>So when there was a common disaster – like a pandemic – virtually everyone faced the same circumstances. If business had to be kept open, all businesses had to be kept open, and all occupations faced the threat of catching the disease at work. If businesses had to be shut, <em>all</em> businesses had to be shut. Nothing could be shifted to a daily Zoom call.</p>
<p>John Barry writes in his book on the 1918 flu pandemic:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At virtually every large employer, huge percentages of employees were absent … Farmers stopped farming and the merchants stopped selling merchandise and the country really more or less just shut down holding their breath … The entire transportation system for the mid-Atlantic region staggered and trembled, putting in jeopardy most of the nation’s industrial output.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s very different today.</p>
<p>Compare the plight of a local restaurant with, say, Facebook. One is shut down, unable to operate without in-person service. The other can get along just fine with its entire workforce working from home.</p>
<p>Same if you contrast food processing plants with tax consultants.</p>
<p>Or American Airlines with American Express.</p>
<p>We are lucky that a lot of today’s economy can shift seamlessly into remote work. It wouldn’t have been possible to this extent if Covid-19 struck in 2010 instead of 2020.</p>
<p>But it again sets up a stark contrast of haves and have nots, and groups of people who are experiencing Covid-19 in different ways.</p>
<p>Massachusetts <a href="https://www.wbur.org/bostonomix/2020/04/10/coronavirus-working-from-home-economic-divides-income-disparity" target="_blank">did a survey</a> in April that tells the story:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>88% of those with an advanced degree can work from home, vs. 35% with a high school degree or less.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>75% of those making more than $150,000 a year can work from home, vs. 44% of those earning less than $50,000 a year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>74% of salaried workers can get their jobs done from home, vs. 40% of hourly workers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a long history of economies being hit with downpours. But this is the first in which perhaps 70% of the economy has a sturdy umbrella while 30% is left to get soaked.</p>
<p>It removes a “we’re-all-in-this-together” aspect of the crises <a href="https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/common-enemies/" target="_blank">that’s key to recovery</a>. It’s not easy to get everyone to cooperate when Covid-19 is a petty annoyance to some and a catastrophe to others. But that’s what we have now. So here we are.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>3. Things have been pretty good for a long time. So a setback, even if it’s not unprecedented, feels overwhelming.</strong></p>
<p>“Everything feels unprecedented when you haven’t engaged with history,” writer Kelly Hayes recently <a href="https://twitter.com/MsKellyMHayes/status/1282093046943952902" target="_blank">wrote</a>.</p>
<p>It’s such a relevant idea today.</p>
<p>Historian Dan Carlin writes in his book <em>The End is Always Near</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Pretty much nothing separates us from human beings in earlier eras than how much less disease affects us … If we moderns lived for one year with the sort of death rates our pre–industrial age ancestors perpetually lived with, we’d be in societal shock.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1900 roughly 800 per 100,000 Americans died each year from infectious disease. By 2014 that was 45.6 per 100,000 – a 94% decline.</p>
<p>Life in general is about as safe as it’s ever been. And effectively all of the improvement over the last century <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2585966" target="_blank">has come from</a> a decline in infectious disease:</p>
<p><figure class="post__figure"><img alt="Sorry Brandt screwed up this image somehow." class="img-fluid" src="https://www.collaborativefund.com/uploads/4-21a227.png"/></figure></p>
<p>This decline is probably the best thing to ever happen to humanity.</p>
<p>To follow that sentence with “but” is a step too far. It’s a wholly good thing.</p>
<p><em>However</em>, it creates an anomaly.</p>
<p>We are medically more prepared to fight disease than ever before. But, psychologically, the mere thought of a pandemic has never felt so foreign, so unprecedented, so upending.</p>
<p>What was a tragic but expected part of life 100 years ago is now a tragic and <em>inconceivable</em> part of life in 2020.</p>
<p>Clark Whelton, a former speechwriter for New York mayor Ed Koch, recently wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My mother once showed me a list of the contagious diseases she survived before the age of 20. On the list were the usual childhood illnesses, along with deadly afflictions like typhoid fever, pneumonia, diphtheria (it killed her older brother), scarlet fever, and the lethal 1918–19 Spanish flu, which took more than 50 million lives around the world.</p>
<p>For those who grew up in the 1930s and 1940s, there was nothing unusual about finding yourself threatened by contagious disease. Mumps, measles, chickenpox, and German measles swept through entire schools and towns; I had all four. Polio took a heavy annual toll, leaving thousands of people (mostly children) paralyzed or dead. There were no vaccines. Growing up meant running an unavoidable gauntlet of infectious disease. For college students in 1957, the Asian flu was a familiar hurdle on the road to adulthood. For everyone older, the flu was a familiar foe. There was no possibility of working at home. You had to go out and face the danger.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Compare this to my generation – who enjoy a dozen vaccines within weeks of birth – and it’s like we live in separate worlds. I can’t fathom what was normal two generations ago.</p>
<p>My guess is if Covid-19 struck the world in 1920, it would be a single page in the history books about yet another deadly pandemic wedged in between a long list of common tragedies. But here we are: Since it happened in 2020 it will be a generation-defining event <a href="https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/wounds-heal-scars-last/" target="_blank">that fundamentally reshapes</a> how we think about risk.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>4. Local news gave way to national news which gave way to global news, which can make the world feel perpetually broken because there is always a tragedy somewhere, and now you are guaranteed to hear about it</strong>.</p>
<p>Historian Frederick Lewis Allan describes how Americans stayed informed in the year 1900:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is hard for us today to realize how very widely communities were separated from one another when they depended for transportation wholly on the railroad and the horse and wagon–and when telephones were still scarce, and radios non-existent.</p>
<p>There were sharp limits to the fund of information and ideas which people of all regions and all walks of life held in common. To some extent a Maine fisherman, an Ohio farmer, and a Chicago businessman would be able to discuss politics with one another, but in the absence of syndicated newspaper columns appearing from coast to coast their information would be based mostly upon what they had read in very divergent local newspapers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Information was harder to disseminate over distances, and what was going on in other parts of the country or the world just wasn’t your top concern – information was local because life was local.</p>
<p>Radio changed that in a big way. It connected people to a common source of information.</p>
<p>TV did it even more.</p>
<p>The internet took it to the next level.</p>
<p>Digital news killed local papers and made information global. Eighteen hundred U.S. print media outlets <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/07/ghosting-news-margaret-sullivans-alarm-bell/614011/" target="_blank">disappeared</a> from 2004 to 2017. Meanwhile, almost 20% of New York Times subscribers now live outside the United States. “We believe there is a very big opportunity for <em>The New York Times</em> to be one of the handful of dominant global news producers,” the Times’ COO said last year. A few digital outlets – CNN, Fox, Google News, Yahoo News, Facebook – command an overwhelming share of people’s attention.</p>
<p>The decline of local news has all kinds of implications. One that doesn’t get much attention is that the wider the news becomes the more likely it is to be pessimistic.</p>
<p>Two things make that so:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Bad news gets more attention than good news because pessimism is seductive and feels more urgent than optimism.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The odds of a bad news story – a fraud, a corruption, a disaster – occurring in your local town at any given moment is low. When you expand your attention nationally, the odds increase. When they expand globally, the odds of something terrible happening in any given moment are 100%.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To exaggerate only a little: Local news reports on softball tournaments. Global news reports on genocides and plane crashes.</p>
<p>A researcher once ranked the sentiment of news over time, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/17/steven-pinker-media-negative-news" target="_blank">and found</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The New York Times got steadily more morose from the early 1960s to the early 1970s, lightened up a bit (but just a bit) in the 1980s and 1990s, and then sank into a progressively worse mood in the first decade of the new century. News outlets in the rest of the world, too, became gloomier and gloomier from the late 1970s to the present day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We just get a different kind of news today than people got for most of history.</p>
<p>Here’s Lewis Allan again, writing about life in 1900:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The majority of Americans were less likely than their descendants to be dogged by that frightening sense of insecurity which comes from being jostled by forces – economic, political, international – beyond one’s personal ken. Their horizons were close to them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Their horizons were close to them</em>. Today our horizons cover every nation, culture, political regime and economy.</p>
<p>There are <a href="https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/you-can-see-where-this-is-going/" target="_blank">so many good thing</a>s that come from that.</p>
<p>But we shouldn’t be surprised that the world feels historically broken in recent years. <a href="https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/2020-what-a-time-to-be-alive/" target="_blank">It’s not</a> – we just see more of the bad stuff than ever before.</p>
<hr/>
<p><strong>5. The Federal Reserve learned how to keep the financial system from falling apart. That’s both kept a lot of the economy humming and ruined a lot of assumptions people had about how the economy works</strong>.</p>
<p>In 2002, former Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke gave a speech at Milton Friedman’s 90th birthday.</p>
<p>Friedman, one of the most influential economists of the 20th century, spent his career arguing that the Fed caused the Great Depression by not preventing a decline in the money supply.</p>
<p>Bernanke <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/BOARDDOCS/SPEECHES/2002/20021108/" target="_blank">ended his talk</a> by saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I would like to say to Milton and Anna: Regarding the Great Depression. You’re right, we did it.</p>
<p>We’re very sorry.</p>
<p>But thanks to you, we won’t do it again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was a joke, but he wasn’t joking.</p>
<p>In 2008 Bernanke, as Fed chairman, flooded the financial system with an unprecedented amount of liquidity.</p>
<p>It worked, which is why we call 2008 the Great Recession and not the Second Great Depression.</p>
<p>It also paved the way for Bernanke’s successors to open the monetary floodgates when the economy tumbles.</p>
<p>Jerome Powell, Bernanke’s successor, injected more than $4 trillion into the financial system between September and June. That’s double what Bernanke did in 2008. In March and April this year the Fed <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidSchawel/status/1282510445316919298" target="_blank">bought more than</a> 100% of all mortgage-backed securities issued, meaning it funded roughly all new mortgages and purchased billions more from existing investors.</p>
<p>Bernanke was given flak for cutting interest rates in 2008. Powell is now <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-bought-about-1-3-billion-corporate-bonds-in-late-june-11594396039" target="_blank">buying corporate-bond ETFs</a> in the open market.</p>
<p><em>Things have changed.</em></p>
<p>And they’re <a href="https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/never-the-same/" target="_blank">probably not going back</a>, because people have a new set of expectations about what the Fed can and should do.</p>
<p>The Fed is 107 years old. It seems like a long time. But it’s only been able to learn from two or three deep financial crises during its existence, which isn’t many. So it’s basically just now learned what to do when the economy tanks.</p>
<p>That’s a big deal, because a lot of what we thought we know about what economies do during recessions has been upended.</p>
<p>Josh Brown recently wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Generations of investors had been taught that, in a bear market, the most gruesome casualties would be the highest-flying, most expensive stocks. This time, the experience has been the opposite. There are a lot of “textbook” ideas that won’t survive coronavirus and this is one of them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When interest rates are zero and liquidity floods the market, the value of a company’s future cash flows rises. That’s the technical part. The interesting part is that when future cash flows become more valuable, the stories that lead people to believe in the prospect of future cash flows become more important. That’s part of how Tesla becomes worth $300 billion, or Nikola becomes worth $25 billion before it’s made a single car. Stories about what the future might be become more important than what the present actually is.</p>
<p>Or think about the fact that the stock market seems unreasonably high right now – even bubbly – but it’s still dramatically underperformed long-term Treasury bonds over the last 20 years.</p>
<p>It’s hard to make sense of that world. It’s a world that would have seemed unfathomable 20 years ago.</p>
<p>But here we are.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>To solve logic-proof problems requires intelligent, logical people to admit the possibility they might be wrong about something, but these people’s minds are often most resistant to change - perhaps because their status is deeply entwined with their capacity for reason.. Highly educated people don’t merely use logic; it is part of their identity. When I told one economist that you can often increase the sales of a product by increasing its price, the reaction was one not of curiosity, but of anger.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The supply of nasopharyngeal swabs that are used in every diagnostic test also ran low, because one of the largest manufacturers is based in Lombardy, Italy—initially the COVID‑19 capital of Europe. About 40 percent of critical-care drugs, including antibiotics and painkillers, became scarce because they depend on manufacturing lines that begin in China and India. Once a vaccine is ready, there might not be enough vials to put it in, because of the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-vaccine-glass-vial-shortage-could-delay-global-rollout-2020-5" target="_blank">long-running global shortage of medical-grade glass</a>—literally, a bottle-neck bottleneck.</p>

<p>46% of the Black labor force in California has filed an unemployment claim since March.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Revenue management—the science of getting the highest price for an airline seat, hotel room or other perishable good or service—is based largely on historical data. With big-data computing, airlines know with surprising precision what the demand will be for the 2 p.m. flight to Chicago on the third Thursday of October. Except now they don’t, since so much of revenue management is based on past buying with no relation to a pandemic.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Credit-card debt in the U.S. and other advanced economies has fallen. Fewer people are late on their credit-card payments. Consumer demand for new borrowing—through credit cards, personal loans and even pawnshops—is down sharply.</p>
<p>The main reason, according to economists and financial executives, is government stimulus programs launched in the U.S. and other advanced economies that have worked unexpectedly well. The flood of money, along with debt-relief measures such as deferred-mortgage and student-loan payments, has stabilized the finances of many households and even left some in better shape than before the pandemic—at least for now.</p>

<section class="longform drop container container--narrow">
<p>A few things that always change, never staying in one place for long:</p>
<p><strong>1. The information and metrics people pay attention to always change. So even if you know what’s going to happen, you don’t know whether other people will care.</strong></p>
<p>James Grant says successful investing is about “getting everyone else to agree with you … later.”</p>
<p>Merely predicting what’s going to happen next isn’t enough. To be right you have to predict what’s going to happen next and get millions of other investors to agree that what happened is worth paying attention to in a way that draws their interest and dollars to an investment.</p>
<p>And the things other people pay attention to – the information and metrics that grab our attention – are always changing.</p>
<p>Book value is what investors paid most attention to during the early 20th century. Ben Graham mentions it twice as often as the phrase “net income” in his classic book <em>The Intelligent Investor</em>.</p>
<p>Then it kind of faded away. Profits became the metric of choice for most of the late 20th century.</p>
<p>At other times dividends were the prized metric. In the late 1990s it was page views. In the mid-2000s, user growth.</p>
<p>If Uber was a company in 1985, when investors obsessed over free cash flow, it would be considered a joke. But since it exists in the 2010s, when investors mostly care about revenue growth and brush aside profitability, it became a darling.</p>
<p>Investment facts are always changing. But prediction is doubly hard because the facts investors care about and pay attention to – which is what makes facts relevant – change all the time. Not just by industry, but for the market as a whole.</p>
<p>They change by economic condition, generation, and when a compelling story about a new metric finds its way into enough people’s heads.</p>
<p>The same is true in business, politics, and relationships.</p>
<p>Rarely can you say, “When <em>this</em> happens, <em>that</em> occurs,” because <em>that</em> occurring relies on other people thinking <em>this</em> matters, when their attention may have drifted off to something else.</p>
<p><strong>2. Generational preferences change, shifting demand in ways that’s hard to anticipate because it’s not always linked to a product’s usefulness.</strong></p>
<p>The Beatles, Nike, and LEGO have remained popular across multiple generations.</p>
<p>They are the exceptions.</p>
<p>So many trends that resonate with one generation fail to transfer to the next.</p>
<p>One reason is that it’s hard to feel like you’re moving ahead in life when you associate with your parents’ brands. Every generation wants their own stuff. The odds of getting a 16 year old hooked on Seinfeld or Alanis Morissette round to zero – they are social hand-me-downs. Morgan Stanley could make the indisputably best robo advisor and millennials would still prefer Betterment. That’s how Charles Schwab blossomed in the 1980s and 1990s; with a brand baby boomers felt was theirs, not their parents’. Robinhood is now filling that spot for Gen Z. It does few things the older brokers don’t already do, and it’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/9/21171584/robinhood-outage-week-us-stocks-third-market" target="_blank">constantly breaking down</a>. But young investors love it because it’s theirs.</p>
<p>With rare exceptions, any company whose brand is a signal of “getting it” – getting a new technology, fashion, or being part of a new movement – has a generational shelf life. So no one should be surprised when previous giants cede market share to new entrants, even when the new product is inferior.</p>
<p>Older generations also find it hard to distinguish technological progress from moral decline. The telephone killed the art of letter writing; email killed phone conversations; Slack killed face-to-face meetings, and so on. The traditionalists respond with rebellion. It can take a generation for a great new technology to reach its potential because it takes that long for the older holdout generation to move along – the product version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck%27s_principle" target="_blank">Planck’s Principle.</a> So it’s easy to underestimate change, because it happens slower than you might assume if everyone always used the most useful products available.</p>
<p><strong>3. People use success as an indication of what to keep doing. But most success plants the seeds of its own demise, so what people think works and try to copy is always changing</strong>.</p>
<p>A few things happen when anyone finds success.</p>
<p>The first is that your success attracts competitors who want a bite of their own.</p>
<p>Another is that you’re likely to let your guard down, using success as an excuse to abandon some of the paranoid focus that helped you in the first place.</p>
<p>You’re likely to become locked into a single view, unwilling to abandon what’s worked even as the world evolves.</p>
<p>And you and those who followed you may have mistaken a temporary trend – right place at the right time – for a competitive advantage all along.</p>
<p>That’s how things go. Few bouts of big success – whether it’s a successful company or investment strategy – stay that way indefinitely, because the things that caused success have a tendency to push back in the other direction. The bigger the success, the truer this becomes.</p>
<p>What’s hard is that current successes are the most persuasive instruction manuals for what everyone else should try.</p>
<p>You can’t blame them. They’re doing the right thing: learning and emulating.</p>
<p>But when what works has a shelf life, and people are always trying to copy what works, you realize that a lot of what happens in business and investing is fads coming and going, strategies flourishing and disappearing, popular ideas booming and busting. Always changing.</p>

<p>Americans are smoking more during the coronavirus pandemic because they are spending less on travel and entertainment and have more opportunities to light up. They are also switching back to traditional cigarettes from vaping devices in the wake of federal restrictions on e-cigarette flavors.</p>
<p>Executives at Marlboro maker Altria Group Inc. pointed to the trends Tuesday and said they have been significant enough to slow the yearslong decline in U.S. cigarette sales. Altria now expects U.S. cigarette unit sales to fall by 2% to 3.5% this year compared with its previous projection of a 4%-to-6% decline.</p>

<p>The experts were divided as to what role influenza will play in the fall. A harsh flu season could flood hospitals with pneumonia patients needing ventilators. But some said the flu season could be mild or almost nonexistent this year.</p>
<p>Normally, the flu virus migrates from the Northern Hemisphere to the Southern Hemisphere in the spring — presumably in air travelers — and then returns in the fall, with new mutations that may make it a poor match for the annual vaccine.</p>
<p>But this year, the national lockdown abruptly ended flu transmission in late April, according to <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/index.htm" target="_blank">weekly Fluview reports</a> from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. International air travel has been sharply curtailed, and there has been <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-06-13/flu-cases-drop-amid-coronavirus-restrictions-statistics-show/12332204" target="_blank">almost no flu activity</a> in <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/covid-19-measures-have-all-but-wiped-out-the-flu-in-the-southern-hemisphere-11595440682" target="_blank">the whole southern hemisphere</a> this year.</p>

<p>The attention to the SEO principles of headline writing and distributing content on places like Facebook and Google helped push its content far and wide. “There’s a lot of news out there that people don’t know they want to read,” says a former Business Insider reporter. “The whole mindset at BI is that the traditional media doesn’t know how to do digital. They don’t know how to make readers want to read something.”</p>

<p>Steve Kessel was running Amazon’s media business in 2004 (books/music/DVD’s). Books alone generated more than 50% of Amazon’s cash flow. Jeff fired Steve from his job and reassigned him to build Kindle. Steve’s new mission: destroy his old business.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The U.S. homeownership rate, led by young buyers, jumped to the highest since 2008, signaling that the housing boom underway before the pandemic has only accelerated.</p>
<p>The rate was 67.9% in the second quarter, according to a Census Bureau <a href="https://www.census.gov/housing/hvs/files/currenthvspress.pdf" target="_blank" title="Link to report">report</a> Tuesday. It was the fourth straight increase, climbing from 65.3% in the previous three months. The homeownership rate for buyers under age 35 rose to 40.6%, the highest in almost 12 years.</p>

<p>A truth in one field often shines a light on another. So let me tell you a story about what cats falling out of buildings teaches us about businesses surviving Covid-19.</p>
<p>In 1988 two New York City veterinarians did a study on a topic they had unique insight into: What happens to cats that fell out of the city’s high-rise windows.</p>
<p>They found something counterintuitive: The relationship between the height of a cat’s fall and the injuries it suffers is an upside-down U.</p>
<p>A short fall is safer than a medium-height fall. But there’s a point where the further a cat falls, the <em>less</em> injury it’s likely to face.</p>
<p>It looks like this:</p>
<p><figure class="post__figure"><img alt="Sorry Brandt screwed up this image somehow." class="img-fluid" src="https://www.collaborativefund.com/uploads/Screen%20Shot%202020-07-27%20at%201.37.15%20PM.png"/></figure></p>
<p>What’s happening here?</p>
<p>Potentially lots of things, including dumb luck and cats that didn’t make it to the vet.</p>
<p>But a mix of physics and psychology offers an explanation.</p>
<p>Cats have an amazing ability to right themselves during a fall, their bodies acting like gyroscopes to help them land on their feet.</p>
<p>The quirk is that a falling cat’s initial instinct is to extend its limbs straight down, locked into place. That’s the fastest way it can right itself, which is helpful during short falls. But at medium-height falls (4-7 stories) locked limbs are a liability, prone to snapping as they absorb the brunt of the impact.</p>
<p>Then something interesting happens after about seven stories.</p>
<p>Cats hit terminal velocity at about 60 miles per hour, which they’ll achieve after falling about 90 feet. That’s when acceleration stops and free fall begins. And just as accelerating from 0-60 mph in a car pushes you into your seat while driving at a constant 70 mph on a freeway doesn’t, things calm down for the cat once acceleration ends and terminal velocity is reached.</p>
<p>The relative calmness of terminal velocity loosens the cat’s locked limbs. As they relax “the vestibular system is no longer stimulated and the cat orients its limbs horizontally,” one study wrote.</p>
<p>That sets up a safer, gentler landing.</p>
<p>Jared Diamond <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/332586a0.pdf" target="_blank">explained</a> in a 1988 article in <em>Nature</em> that the horizontal limbs come out “in flying-squirrel fashion, thus not only reducing the velocity of fall but also absorbing the impact over a greater area of its body.”</p>
<p>Risk isn’t always intuitive: Higher falls give cats time to prepare for a safer landing.</p>
<p>This has obvious limits. The final distribution might look more like an N than an inverted U, with super-high falls leading to the most injuries. (Please don’t test this at home).</p>
<p>But there’s an important observation:</p>
<p>Risk depends on how hasty your response must be. A small problem you have to scramble to protect yourself from with a snap judgement can be more dangerous than a larger problem you have time to deal with.</p>
<p>That’s as true for businesses as it is for our poor cats.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Every business will be impacted by Covid-19. Some worse than others. But one of the biggest differences in how much permanent damage 2020 will cause is whether a business has to scramble to protect itself or calmly deal with the new world.</p>
<p>Let me give you an example.</p>
<p>United Airlines wasn’t in good shape before Covid. Then the bottom fell out. It may be <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/united-warns-it-may-furlough-36-000-staff-11594222563" target="_blank">about to lay off</a> half its staff, which is the kind of thing that’s hard to recover from even if demand returns. Workers will <a href="https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/what-next/" target="_blank">go find something else to do</a>.</p>
<p>Southwest Airlines is in a different spot.</p>
<p>Long one of the most efficiently run airlines, its CEO told employees this month:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I want you all to know we will not furlough or layoff any Southwest employees on October 1 [when bailout funds expire], unlike our major competitors. Further, we have no intentions of seeking furloughs, layoffs, pay rate cuts, or benefits cuts through at least the end of this year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He went on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In January of this year, we had the lowest amount of debt to total capital in our history and a surplus of cash from 2019’s strong profits. We were prepared for the unexpected.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>United is cutting 60% of its flight capacity later this year. Southwest is cutting 25%, its CEO noting that “we need be careful of making any major adjustments to the schedule. It could actually do more harm than good.”</p>
<p>United stock is down 64% year to date; Southwest, 36%.</p>
<p>Both airlines faced the same risk, the same virus, the same industry collapse. But United had to scramble towards a brutal fix while Southwest can breathe and think through a solution. It will likely make all the difference in the world.</p>
<p>Risk is weird like that.</p>
<p>There is no topic in business and investing that gets more attention than risk. But it’s almost always viewed through a universal lens: “What risks are we going to face in the future?” Or just simply, “What’s the economy going to do next?”</p>
<p>But risk has little to do with what’s going to happen next and a lot to do with how much you can endure, and how calmly you can react to, whatever happens next.</p>
<p>To the leveraged investor a small setback is a huge risk because of how they’re forced to deal with decline: by selling to cover their debts, right now, this moment, whatever the price is. Don’t think, just scramble to do what you gotta do in the face of panic. They’re like the cat locking its limbs into place, doing whatever they can to survive even if it breaks them to pieces.</p>
<p>To the patient investor with a ton of cash, a huge market decline requires no immediate action. And not because it doesn’t affect them – it often does – but because however it affects them can be dealt with slowly and methodically. Maybe they realize they want a more conservative allocation. They can come to that conclusion after thinking it through, hearing opposing views, weighing alternatives, and calmly executing at the right time. Doing so may lead them to a different choice than their initial gut reaction. Taking time to understand a complicated problem often does.</p>
<p>That’s the thing: The difference between snap reactions vs. taking your time to think is night and day.</p>
<p>Daniel Kahneman’s book <em>Thinking, Fast and Slow</em> is a play on his idea that you have two types of thinking: System 1, which is fast and instinctual (cat locking its limbs out) and System 2, which is slow and deliberate (cat relaxing and pushing its limbs horizontally).</p>
<p>He writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>System 2 is the only one that can follow rules, compare objects on several attributes, and make deliberate choices between options. The automatic System 1 does not have these capabilities. System 1 detects simple relations and excels at integrating information about one thing, but it does not deal with multiple distinct topics at once, nor is it adept at using purely statistical information.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Think about how complex the business and investing problems we face in 2020 are.</p>
<p>When will there be a vaccine?</p>
<p>How much will government stimulus change things?</p>
<p>Will consumer behavior be permanently altered?</p>
<p>Who wins the election?</p>
<p>What will governors do?</p>
<p>What will the Fed do?</p>
<p>What do all these things happening at the same time mean?</p>
<p>There are so many moving parts, so much nuance.</p>
<p>So much need to think slowly, wait for more data, and come up with a plan that isn’t a forced reaction to a single piece of news.</p>
<p>Some companies can. Some investors can.</p>
<p>But to me the most universal lesson of 2020 is the value of room for error.</p>
<p>Avoiding, as much as possible, the scramble of making snap decisions because you don’t have time to think through a problem with a deliberate long-term strategy.</p>
<p>Embracing, as much as possible, anything that gives you time, options, and flexibility.</p>
<p>Like a cat with nine lives.</p>
