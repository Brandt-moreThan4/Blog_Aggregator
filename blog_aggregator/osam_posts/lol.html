<p>No investment principle is more widely understood and frequently ignored than ‘buy low, sell high’. While we would not hesitate to buy at discounted prices in other aspects of life, investing in assets with poor recent returns just feels wrong. However, it is <em>because</em> buying stocks at discounted prices feels wrong, that it can often turn out to be right.</p><p>Amid an almost unprecedented market environment in which coronavirus has shut down global economies, there are relatively few investors showing enthusiasm for equities in the near-term. Despite lower valuations implying better future investment outcomes, our human instinct tells us not to buy. This is why OSAM favors a systematic approach that prevents our instincts and emotions from inhibiting good decision-making. While the media provides endless reasons to feel pessimistic, the <em>evidence</em> shows attractive opportunities in the market for long-term investors. As the saying goes, be greedy when others are fearful.</p><p>It is crucial to remember in a downturn that ‘once in a lifetime’ crises also present historic opportunities.</p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 112, 192);">A HISTORIC OPPORTUNITY IN SMALL CAP STOCKS</strong></p><p>Every so often there are opportunities that may only appear 2-3 times in an investor’s career, usually around a bear market or recession. In light of the recent bear market, evidence suggests that a historic opportunity may be forming in small cap stocks, among the lowest returning assets in March (Russell 2000 Index, -21.73%) and Q1 (Russell 2000 Index, -30.61%).</p><p>Yet, small cap stocks are one of the better returning assets after bear markets. As the data below shows, small stocks are generally the lowest performers as markets fall, but then significantly outperform when markets recover. These charts exhibit the average <em>forward</em> returns in the 25 lowest ranking months and rolling quarters for small cap companies. The relative advantage of small cap stocks following market declines is clear:</p><p><img src="https://portalvhdst3l6zspf51mvl.blob.core.windows.net/osam/blogphotos/photo_1742.PNG" width="1093"/></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 112, 192);">THE CASE FOR SMALL CAP VALUE</strong></p><p>There is ample data demonstrating the outperformance of smaller cheaper stocks over the long term. The chart below shows the annualized excess return of small cap stocks within each decile of stocks measured by their cheapness. On the far left, the cheapest stocks generated an annualized excess return of 5.1% over the 54-year study, while the most expensive stocks on the far right underperformed by -11.0% annualized.</p><p><img src="https://portalvhdst3l6zspf51mvl.blob.core.windows.net/osam/blogphotos/photo_1741.PNG" width="1011"/></p><p>That said, while there may be a historic opportunity in small cap companies as a whole, small cap <em>value</em> stocks are particularly attractive.</p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 112, 192);">Small Cap Value &amp; Large Cap Growth Spreads Near All Time Highs</span></p><p>Using history as a guide, the current environment in small cap stocks is almost unprecedented. When comparing the earnings yield of the cheapest small stocks (cheapest decile by price-to-earnings) to the most expensive decile of large cap stocks in the US <strong>we see a spread of more than 21%</strong>. Following extreme periods like this historically, <strong>small value outperformed large growth by 16.8% annualized over the following 10 years.</strong></p><p><img src="https://portalvhdst3l6zspf51mvl.blob.core.windows.net/osam/blogphotos/photo_1740.PNG" width="1138"/></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 112, 192);">Earnings Yield Spread on Small Cap Value &amp; 10-Year Treasury Near All Time Highs</span></p><p>A similar dynamic exists in the earnings yield on small cap stocks (cheapest decile) and the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield. This spread is generally between 3-6%, but is greater than 20% today. <strong>Following similar spreads in the past, small value stocks returned an average of 27.9% in the subsequent 10-year period.</strong></p><p><img src="https://portalvhdst3l6zspf51mvl.blob.core.windows.net/osam/blogphotos/photo_1739.PNG" width="1142"/></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 112, 192);">INCORPORATING QUALITY IN SMALL CAP VALUE </strong></p><p>While small cap value has a long record of generating meaningful outperformance, we must emphasize that investors should not simply buy the cheapest decile of small stocks. Due to their size, small cap companies are generally more susceptible to economic shocks like the one we currently face. By merely buying the cheapest group of small cap stocks, there is no safeguard protecting investors from unstable companies ill-prepared for an economic downturn.</p><p>For this reason, it is <em>crucial</em> to incorporate quality factors in the investment process for avoiding these unprepared and ill-equipped companies. At OSAM, we screen out companies from our investable universe that score poorly on <em>Financial Strength</em> (highly levered companies reliant on external funding), <em>Earnings Quality</em> (companies with non-cash earnings and aggressive accounting), and <em>Earnings Growth</em> (declining free cash flow and profitability). These quality factors have an even greater impact in the small cap universe:</p><p><img src="https://portalvhdst3l6zspf51mvl.blob.core.windows.net/osam/blogphotos/photo_1743.PNG" width="797"/></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 112, 192);">Reducing Risk in Market Downturns Through Quality Factors</span></p><p>There is a popular model in financial history called the Kindleberger-Minsky model, which states that the ‘fraud cycle’ lags the market cycle. Said differently, frauds and bad businesses usually don’t get exposed until markets fall, and investors became more skeptical and conservative. The infamous Worldcom fiasco after the Dot Com crash, and Bernie Madoff’s ponzi scheme blowing up amid the Great Financial Crisis are prime examples.</p><p>This is relevant for investors because it means market downturns simultaneously create historic opportunities to buy stocks at lower prices, but also pose increased risks as companies with questionable accounting and business models are exposed. The first quarter of 2020 offered a glimpse of this phenomenon. Before the downturn began on February 19th, when markets were up and sentiment was high, companies in the lowest decile of our quality measures outperformed the market. When markets dropped, however, these low quality companies significantly underperformed as investors sought refuge in companies with good financial strength and earnings growth.</p><p><img src="https://portalvhdst3l6zspf51mvl.blob.core.windows.net/osam/blogphotos/photo_1737.PNG" width="1195"/></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 112, 192);">OSAM SMALL CAP VALUE STRATEGY</strong></p><p>There is clearly risk in indiscriminately buying small cap stocks during market downturns. In OSAM’s Small Cap Value strategy our Earnings Quality, Financial Strength and Earnings Growth overlays ensure that while investing in one of the better returning assets exiting downturns, the strategy is only buying companies with good financials and strong fundamentals, <strong>while avoiding the lowest scoring</strong>.</p><p>To demonstrate the efficacy of this approach, our systematic use of Quality as an exclusionary factor has been critical in avoiding worst-case scenarios like bankruptcy. The chart below shows that 92% of bankruptcies in the small cap space were identified ex-ante by falling into one of the lowest deciles of our quality themes—stocks that we specifically exclude in our process.</p><p><img src="https://portalvhdst3l6zspf51mvl.blob.core.windows.net/osam/blogphotos/photo_1736.PNG" width="1045"/></p><p>What is the result? A portfolio with substantial advantages over the benchmark in terms of valuation, returning cash to shareholders, and quality. As of March 31st, the Small Cap Value portfolio was 25% cheaper than the Russell 2000 Value index (measured by Price/Earnings), had a 1,020% higher Shareholder Yield ratio, and 1-year historical EPS growth rate over 7,000% higher than the benchmark. In terms of quality, the portfolio was significantly less reliant on external financing (527% lower), had a 100% higher Cash Flow-to-Debt ratio, and higher use of accruals (27% lower).</p><p><img src="https://portalvhdst3l6zspf51mvl.blob.core.windows.net/osam/blogphotos/photo_1735.PNG" width="442"/></p><p>In these times of market stress, we believe the Small Cap Value strategy is poised for strong performance moving forward by investing in one of the better returning categories out of bear markets, holding companies with significantly better characteristics than the benchmark, and investing at near record-high earnings yield spreads with other assets, implying higher future returns.</p><p>Since March 2004 through March 31st, 2020 the Small Cap Value SMA outperformed the Russell 2000 Value benchmark in 92% of rolling 5-year periods (3.3% Avg. Excess Return), and 95% of rolling 10-year periods (3.3% Avg. Excess Return).</p><p>If you’re interested in learning more about our research, our Small Cap Value strategy is available in both SMA and mutual fund investment vehicles, please reach out to our team.

<p><br/></p><p>March 23, 2020</p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 102, 179);">Blizzard, Winter, or Ice Age</strong></p><p>The past two weeks have been a brutal market blizzard during what is now almost certainly an economic and investing winter.</p><p>Blizzards are defined by extreme volatility and uncertainty—and we’ve had historic amounts of both since February 20th. I believe that to survive a blizzard you must focus on placing each foot in front of the other. Executing your plan or process, reigning in leverage (if applicable), and avoiding blunders in the confusion. We know that price volatility clusters at periodic peaks of uncertainty—these are market blizzards.</p><p><img src="https://portalvhdst3l6zspf51mvl.blob.core.windows.net/osam/blogphotos/photo_1731.PNG" width="782"/></p><p>A winter is a sustained period of equity market drawdown and negative economic growth and rising unemployment—an economic recession. We have faced many winters before, and while the circumstances that trigger a given winter are always somewhat unique, we’ve always recovered and reached new highs in both the economy and the stock market. In a winter, cost structures change and weak hands (even considering bailouts or loans) fold. Winters have been some of the better times to invest cash into equities, by far. </p><p><img src="https://portalvhdst3l6zspf51mvl.blob.core.windows.net/osam/blogphotos/photo_1730.PNG" width="879"/></p><p>We work with a lot of professional financial intermediaries: financial advisors and investment consultants who manage money for their clients. Talking to many of these people over the past two weeks, it is clear that having enough cash on hand is like having a warm fire during winter, and I personally don’t see anything wrong with making asset allocation changes to secure that fire. But full out panic and liquidation has been the <em>clearly wrong </em>strategy in past winters, especially for younger investors or those with years of cash on hand. I think it’s important to remember that the reality isn’t that people sell at market bottoms, markets bottom because everyone sells. With the S&amp;P 500 down nearly 35% from its peak at the time of this writing, we’ve faced the swiftest drawdown on record. For many it has already been incredibly difficult to stick with a long-term equity allocation. Most behavioral investing errors happen in periods of uncertainty like the one we face today.</p><p>That brings us to the largest open question: is this a winter like we’ve faced before, like those visible in the chart above? Each one was hard and painful, but each was followed by a normal spring and summer on the other side. Or is this an ice age? A period more like the Great Depression or other long periods of decline and stagnation? James Bullard at the St. Louis Fed warned recently of the potential for 30% unemployment and a 50% decline in GDP—both significantly worse than the extreme levels of the Great Depression. </p><p>The October 19th, 1918 issue of the <em>Arkansas Gazette </em>highlighted the many ways in which the Spanish flu had decimated local businesses. A department store’s revenues were down 50%; merchants were down 40-70%; businesses were losing an average of $10,000 per day ($133k in 2007 dollars). Demand was up in drug stores, and for certain products like beds, mattresses, and bedsprings<sup>1</sup>.</p><p>Can the same thing that happened in Little Rock in 1918 happen writ large across the entire U.S. (and global) economy and last for years? Without a serious, swift, and aggressive response, it is possible. But the best data that we have suggests it's improbable.</p><p>We are now in one of those scary periods where returns are determined as much by investor behavior and psychology as by fundamental outcomes. In periods of psychological market stress, data, evidence, and process are <em>critical. </em>We turn to that data to build expectations of where we may go from here.</p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 102, 179);">How to Value the Market, and What Returns to Expect From Here</strong></p><p>We are entering a situation in which traditional methods of market valuation may become less useful as business fundamentals fall precipitously. In that type of situation, we think the best way to value the broad market is by measuring its “integrated equity,” which we define as all capital retained and reinvested by companies, properly adjusted for inflation. Here’s what a chart of total integrated equity looks like since 1988. Notice the slight dip for value stocks in the financial crisis (due to write downs and earnings losses). Notice that the measure remains smooth and steady over time, even through periods of deep recession.</p><p><img src="https://portalvhdst3l6zspf51mvl.blob.core.windows.net/osam/blogphotos/photo_1729.PNG" width="624"/></p><p>The cheaper you can buy stocks based on their integrated equity, the better. Here is an update on the estimated future 10-year returns from our price-to-integrated equity calculation. These return predictions have changed drastically since the beginning of the year:</p><p><img src="https://portalvhdst3l6zspf51mvl.blob.core.windows.net/osam/blogphotos/photo_1734.PNG" width="497"/></p><p>We expect 3%/year for growth stocks (still quite low despite the drop) and 13%/year for value stocks. This is the highest prediction we’ve seen for value since the highest ever in March of 2009 (a prediction which proved close to accurate), when the model predicted a return of nearly 17%/year. </p><p><img src="https://portalvhdst3l6zspf51mvl.blob.core.windows.net/osam/blogphotos/photo_1727.PNG" width="676"/></p><p>﻿These are index return predictions. We think that the way Russell builds indexes is not ideal for investing purposes, and that better tailored value strategies will achieve returns significantly higher than the 13%/year which we expect from the index.</p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 102, 179);">How to Build Equity Portfolios Now</strong></p><p>This is where I talk our own book. Normally we don’t comment on how factors look relative to one another in the near term. But there is nothing normal about the markets right now. In fact, we are witnessing relative investment opportunities in smaller, cheaper stocks that we thought we’d never see again after the madness of the tech-bubble in 2000.</p><p>There are many ways we can evaluate the value of smaller cheaper stocks. We can see how cheap they are relative to fixed income yields, we can see how cheap they are versus their own history, and we can see how cheap they are relative to the large growth category of stocks that have led this market cycle since 2009 and <em>thus far</em> have led the market in this drawdown.</p><p>In each case, we see historic readings. As one example, when we compare the earnings yield of the cheapest small stocks (cheapest decile by price-to-earnings) to the most expensive decile of large cap stocks, we see a spread of more than 21%. Following extreme periods like this historically, small value outperformed large growth by 16.8%/year over the subsequent 10 years. </p><p><img src="https://portalvhdst3l6zspf51mvl.blob.core.windows.net/osam/blogphotos/photo_1732.PNG" width="703"/></p><p>We can also compare the earnings yield on small cap stocks (cheapest decile) to the yield on the U.S. government 10-year bond. Most of the time, that spread is between 3-6%. Today it is greater than 20%. Following similar spreads in the past, small value stocks returned an average of 27.9% in the subsequent 10-year period.</p><p><img src="https://portalvhdst3l6zspf51mvl.blob.core.windows.net/osam/blogphotos/photo_1733.PNG" width="701"/></p><p>We use small value here as a simple proxy for many quantitative strategies but must emphasize that we don’t think you should just buy the cheapest decile of stocks. We know that many stocks will suffer huge earnings declines, and so quality and trend remain critically important in any investing modeling process. Since the market peak on February 20th, we’ve seen how important quality can be. In this chart you can see that across our quality factors, low quality stocks have done much worse than the market. We think these factors will remain important from here. </p><p><img src="https://portalvhdst3l6zspf51mvl.blob.core.windows.net/osam/blogphotos/photo_1723.PNG" width="603"/></p><p>Value has been pummeled for years, and now even more acutely for weeks during the COVID market crash. As a result, we are now faced with historic readings and perhaps a historic opportunity. This isn’t to say the market doesn’t have more downside—I have no clue when the blizzard will end. But the data suggests the market as a whole will reward investors, and that it will reward investors focused on quality and valuations even more.</p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 102, 179);">Is the World Going to End?</strong></p><p>Since I’ve been unable to sleep this week, I’ve been rereading Frank Herbert’s <em>Dune</em> at night—the book where we get the famous quote: “fear is the mind killer” (which everyone and their brother is trotting out right now)<em>. </em>It is a damn good passage:</p><p class="ql-indent-2">"I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain."</p><p>We are in a state of global fear and uncertainty. I’ve been asked a lot about what I’ll call “ice age hedges”—through a combination of cash, productive hard assets, or even unproductive scarce assets like gold and bitcoin. I’ll admit that because it's possible (though again, in my view, improbable) that we face a true ice age, I can’t argue with ice age hedges of some type. Personally, I am not buying these things, and am keeping normal cash on hand—but I understand those that are.</p><p>With the country—and world—shut down, can we cross the chasm, help businesses survive the revenue drought, and re-emerge on the other side? I believe that we can. I am an optimist. I believe in the resilience of people, and of this country and the world. I believe that it is hard to bake this resilience and the human response into epidemic models, and so I am optimistic that our response to this menace will curtail the worst-case outcomes, and that we will avoid an ice age.</p><p>I have hope. But as Herbert writes in <em>Dune </em>soon after the famous <em>fear </em>passage, “hope clouds observation.” I agree. Fear is the mind-killer but hope alone is insufficient. We must quickly embrace reality and then seek to improve it. We must focus on the things in our control that we can make go up as prices go down, that we can improve as things devolve. In our case that means perfect execution, more research than ever, more transparent conversations than ever, more information sharing than ever, and a constant assessment and appropriate rebalancing of portfolios. I know everyone else is starting to do the same: asking how they can help, how they can fight, how they can survive and advance, better than before. I promise that everyone at OSAM will be a small part of that fight. </p><p> </p><p><sup>1</sup> <a href="https://www.stlouisfed.org/~/media/files/pdfs/community-development/research-reports/pandemic_flu_report.pdf" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);" target="_blank">https://www.stlouisfed.org/~/media/files/pdfs/community-development/research-reports/pandemic_flu_report.pdf</a></p><p><br/></p><p><strong>﻿General Legal Disclosures &amp; Hypothetical and/or Backtested Results Disclaimer</strong></p><p class="ql-align-justify">The material contained herein is intended as a general market commentary.

<p>March 10, 2020</p><p><br/></p><p>OSAM clients,</p><p>Like everyone we are watching markets and the coronavirus carefully and thinking of ways to be safe and helpful. In acutely painful markets, we have two goals.</p><p>First, to execute our firm’s strategies as flawlessly as we can with a clear emphasis on trading and portfolio management, risk management and rebalancing, and client communication.</p><p>Second, to keep our employees safe, secure, and supported and to do the same for clients to the extent we can, by making their jobs easier if possible. This includes any information or reporting that we can muster that provides perspective for clients. If we can do something to help, tell us.</p><p>In the spirit of sharing information, we provide some very simple looks inside the market below (with data through and including the dramatic sell-off on March 9th).</p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 102, 179);">Factor Performance </strong></p><p>Value has continued its terrible run of performance, dragging many quantitative strategies, ours included. Value strategies that are heavily exposed to Energy and Bank stocks will be the hardest hit, which highlights the need for smart diversification within a factor-based strategy. We’ve always advocated a diversified factor approach, which is helping in this period—but value’s poor performance has taken its toll. Luckily, quality factors have helped especially those which focus on avoiding companies with overleveraged balance sheets and poor earnings trends (right-most two charts below).</p><p>Here are factor returns since the market peak in late February through March 9th. </p><p><img src="https://portalvhdst3l6zspf51mvl.blob.core.windows.net/osam/blogphotos/photo_1718.PNG"/></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 102, 179);">Markets</strong></p><p>We maintain several models internally which serve as guideposts for future market returns. We don’t think that equity returns can be predicted with any real accuracy over horizons less than 5 years, and 10-year projections are much more stable (and still hugely imperfect). Still these models are helpful reminders because they use business fundamentals and market prices as their primary inputs. They don’t take news into account (which is both a strength and a weakness). Both models have changed considerably in recent weeks.</p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 102, 179);">Price-to-Integrated-Equity</strong></p><p>Our price/integrated equity (PIE) return prediction now forecasts a 10-year return of 5%/year for U.S. stocks. That is up massively from the 1%/year prediction as of the end of 2019. The model is very simple: it compares market price to “integrated equity,” which is a growing and inflation adjusted measure of retained earnings. Think of it like a better, cleaner book value. This model is built to not “overreact” to recent changes in corporate earnings, so even when near term earnings take a serious hit as a result of the virus + oil market moves, our return prediction will likely continue to look more attractive now than at the end of last year. </p><p><img src="https://portalvhdst3l6zspf51mvl.blob.core.windows.net/osam/blogphotos/photo_1722.PNG"/></p><p>We also maintain a second internal model which we call “machine valuation,” developed by our co-CIO Chris Meredith and his team. The model is designed to “predict” <em>today’s</em> market value for every company in the U.S. (and therefore broad indexes as well). Think of it as a model to calculate our view of intrinsic value. We can then compare our estimation of intrinsic value with <em>actual </em>market values. We compare the two in the charts below. We will elaborate on these models in a future paper.</p><p>For the Russell 1000, you can see the market has appeared overvalued for some time (mostly because of growth stocks) but that the gap has narrowed considerably in the last month. Perhaps more interesting, the Russell 1000 Value is now trading <em>below</em> our estimate of intrinsic value, while Growth remains considerably elevated. </p><p><img src="https://portalvhdst3l6zspf51mvl.blob.core.windows.net/osam/blogphotos/photo_1721.PNG"/></p><p>Again, models like this are by no means perfect. We offer them here not to say, “don’t panic,” because in the short-term prices are unpredictable and may continue sharply lower. Instead we share these models to highlight that with a long investing horizon, odds are that prices today will lead to better returns than were available just two months ago.</p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 102, 179);">Focus</strong></p><p>We will be using off-market hours to gather and share as much information as we can across topics and asset classes. I personally will release conversations in podcast format with experts from Oil &amp; Gas, corporate credit, and venture capital in the coming days to share what people are seeing on the front lines.</p><p>Most investors have a long-term allocation to stocks because of the overwhelming historical evidence in favor of such an allocation. Our desire to “do something” in a crisis, to offer a port in the storm, is only human. It is during crises when systems and processes tend to break, so while our systems are built for this, our primary focus is taking extra care on execution and support.</p><p><span style="color: black;"> </span></p><p><span style="color: black;">Patrick</span></p><p><span style="color: black;">Chief Executive Officer and Portfolio Manager</span></p><p><br/></p><p><strong>General Legal Disclosures &amp; Hypothetical and/or Backtested Results Disclaimer</strong></p><p class="ql-align-justify">The material contained herein is intended as a general market commentary.

Historical performance results for investment indices and/or categories have been provided for general comparison purposes only, and generally do not reflect the deduction of transaction and/or custodial charges, the deduction of an investment management fee, nor the impact of taxes, the incurrence of which would have the effect of decreasing historical performance results. It should not be assumed that your account holdings correspond directly to any comparative indices.

If actual accounts had been managed throughout the period, ongoing research might have resulted in changes to the strategy which might have altered returns. The performance of any account or investment strategy managed by OSAM will differ from the hypothetical backtested performance results for each factor shown herein for a number of reasons, including without limitation the following:</p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 112, 192);">▪ </span>Although OSAM may consider from time to time one or more of the factors noted herein in managing any account, it may not consider all or any of such factors. OSAM may (and will) from time to time consider factors in addition to those noted herein in managing any account.</p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 112, 192);">▪ </span>OSAM may rebalance an account more frequently or less frequently than annually and at times other than presented herein.</p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 112, 192);">▪ </span>OSAM may from time to time manage an account by using non-quantitative, subjective investment management methodologies in conjunction with the application of factors.</p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 112, 192);">▪ </span>The hypothetical backtested performance results assume full investment, whereas an account managed by OSAM may have a positive cash position upon rebalance. Had the hypothetical backtested performance results included a positive cash position, the results would have been different and generally would have been lower.</p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 112, 192);">▪ </span>The hypothetical backtested performance results for each factor do not reflect any transaction costs of buying and selling securities, investment management fees (including without limitation management fees and performance fees), custody and other costs, or taxes – all of which would be incurred by an investor in any account managed by OSAM. If such costs and fees were reflected, the hypothetical backtested performance results would be lower. <span style="color: black;">Therefore, it should be noted that on the previous pages of this presentation, any back-tested results may be reflected gross of fees. Had OSAM managed the back-tested Portfolio during the corresponding time period, the deduction of an OSAM fee would have decreased the reflected results. For example, the deduction of a 1.00% fee over a 10-year period would have reduced a 10% gross of fees gain to an 8.9% net of fees gain.</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 112, 192);">▪ </span>The hypothetical performance does not reflect the reinvestment of dividends and distributions therefrom, interest, capital gains and withholding taxes.</p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 112, 192);">▪ </span>Accounts managed by OSAM are subject to additions and redemptions of assets under management, which may positively or negatively affect performance depending generally upon the timing of such events in relation to the market’s direction.</p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(0, 112, 192);">▪ </span>Simulated returns may be dependent on the market and economic conditions that existed during the period. Future market or economic conditions can adversely affect the returns.</p><p><strong style="color: black;">Composite Performance Summary</strong></p><p><span style="color: black;">For full composite performance summaries. please follow this link: </span><a href="http://www.osam.com/" style="color: rgb(5, 99, 193);" target="_blank">http://www.osam.com</a></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(60, 70, 71);">O’Shaughnessy Asset Management – Canvas™ Disclosures</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(60, 70, 71);">O’SHAUGHNESSY ASSET MANAGEMENT, L.L.C.</span></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p>
