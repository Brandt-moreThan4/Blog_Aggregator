<p>No investment principle is more widely understood and frequently ignored than ‘buy low, sell high’. While we would not hesitate to buy at discounted prices in other aspects of life, investing in assets with poor recent returns just feels wrong. However, it is <em>because</em> buying stocks at discounted prices feels wrong, that it can often turn out to be right.</p><p>Amid an almost unprecedented market environment in which coronavirus has shut down global economies, there are relatively few investors showing enthusiasm for equities in the near-term. Despite lower valuations implying better future investment outcomes, our human instinct tells us not to buy. This is why OSAM favors a systematic approach that prevents our instincts and emotions from inhibiting good decision-making. While the media provides endless reasons to feel pessimistic, the <em>evidence</em> shows attractive opportunities in the market for long-term investors. As the saying goes, be greedy when others are fearful.</p><p>It is crucial to remember in a downturn that ‘once in a lifetime’ crises also present historic opportunities.</p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 112, 192);">A HISTORIC OPPORTUNITY IN SMALL CAP STOCKS</strong></p><p>Every so often there are opportunities that may only appear 2-3 times in an investor’s career, usually around a bear market or recession. In light of the recent bear market, evidence suggests that a historic opportunity may be forming in small cap stocks, among the lowest returning assets in March (Russell 2000 Index, -21.73%) and Q1 (Russell 2000 Index, -30.61%).</p><p>Yet, small cap stocks are one of the better returning assets after bear markets. As the data below shows, small stocks are generally the lowest performers as markets fall, but then significantly outperform when markets recover. These charts exhibit the average <em>forward</em> returns in the 25 lowest ranking months and rolling quarters for small cap companies. The relative advantage of small cap stocks following market declines is clear:</p><p><img src="https://portalvhdst3l6zspf51mvl.blob.core.windows.net/osam/blogphotos/photo_1742.PNG" width="1093"/></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 112, 192);">THE CASE FOR SMALL CAP VALUE</strong></p><p>There is ample data demonstrating the outperformance of smaller cheaper stocks over the long term. The chart below shows the annualized excess return of small cap stocks within each decile of stocks measured by their cheapness. On the far left, the cheapest stocks generated an annualized excess return of 5.1% over the 54-year study, while the most expensive stocks on the far right underperformed by -11.0% annualized.</p><p><img src="https://portalvhdst3l6zspf51mvl.blob.core.windows.net/osam/blogphotos/photo_1741.PNG" width="1011"/></p><p>That said, while there may be a historic opportunity in small cap companies as a whole, small cap <em>value</em> stocks are particularly attractive.</p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 112, 192);">Small Cap Value &amp; Large Cap Growth Spreads Near All Time Highs</span></p><p>Using history as a guide, the current environment in small cap stocks is almost unprecedented. When comparing the earnings yield of the cheapest small stocks (cheapest decile by price-to-earnings) to the most expensive decile of large cap stocks in the US <strong>we see a spread of more than 21%</strong>. Following extreme periods like this historically, <strong>small value outperformed large growth by 16.8% annualized over the following 10 years.</strong></p><p><img src="https://portalvhdst3l6zspf51mvl.blob.core.windows.net/osam/blogphotos/photo_1740.PNG" width="1138"/></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 112, 192);">Earnings Yield Spread on Small Cap Value &amp; 10-Year Treasury Near All Time Highs</span></p><p>A similar dynamic exists in the earnings yield on small cap stocks (cheapest decile) and the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield. This spread is generally between 3-6%, but is greater than 20% today. <strong>Following similar spreads in the past, small value stocks returned an average of 27.9% in the subsequent 10-year period.</strong></p><p><img src="https://portalvhdst3l6zspf51mvl.blob.core.windows.net/osam/blogphotos/photo_1739.PNG" width="1142"/></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 112, 192);">INCORPORATING QUALITY IN SMALL CAP VALUE </strong></p><p>While small cap value has a long record of generating meaningful outperformance, we must emphasize that investors should not simply buy the cheapest decile of small stocks. Due to their size, small cap companies are generally more susceptible to economic shocks like the one we currently face. By merely buying the cheapest group of small cap stocks, there is no safeguard protecting investors from unstable companies ill-prepared for an economic downturn.</p><p>For this reason, it is <em>crucial</em> to incorporate quality factors in the investment process for avoiding these unprepared and ill-equipped companies. At OSAM, we screen out companies from our investable universe that score poorly on <em>Financial Strength</em> (highly levered companies reliant on external funding), <em>Earnings Quality</em> (companies with non-cash earnings and aggressive accounting), and <em>Earnings Growth</em> (declining free cash flow and profitability). These quality factors have an even greater impact in the small cap universe:</p><p><img src="https://portalvhdst3l6zspf51mvl.blob.core.windows.net/osam/blogphotos/photo_1743.PNG" width="797"/></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 112, 192);">Reducing Risk in Market Downturns Through Quality Factors</span></p><p>There is a popular model in financial history called the Kindleberger-Minsky model, which states that the ‘fraud cycle’ lags the market cycle. Said differently, frauds and bad businesses usually don’t get exposed until markets fall, and investors became more skeptical and conservative. The infamous Worldcom fiasco after the Dot Com crash, and Bernie Madoff’s ponzi scheme blowing up amid the Great Financial Crisis are prime examples.</p><p>This is relevant for investors because it means market downturns simultaneously create historic opportunities to buy stocks at lower prices, but also pose increased risks as companies with questionable accounting and business models are exposed. The first quarter of 2020 offered a glimpse of this phenomenon. Before the downturn began on February 19th, when markets were up and sentiment was high, companies in the lowest decile of our quality measures outperformed the market. When markets dropped, however, these low quality companies significantly underperformed as investors sought refuge in companies with good financial strength and earnings growth.</p><p><img src="https://portalvhdst3l6zspf51mvl.blob.core.windows.net/osam/blogphotos/photo_1737.PNG" width="1195"/></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 112, 192);">OSAM SMALL CAP VALUE STRATEGY</strong></p><p>There is clearly risk in indiscriminately buying small cap stocks during market downturns. In OSAM’s Small Cap Value strategy our Earnings Quality, Financial Strength and Earnings Growth overlays ensure that while investing in one of the better returning assets exiting downturns, the strategy is only buying companies with good financials and strong fundamentals, <strong>while avoiding the lowest scoring</strong>.</p><p>To demonstrate the efficacy of this approach, our systematic use of Quality as an exclusionary factor has been critical in avoiding worst-case scenarios like bankruptcy. The chart below shows that 92% of bankruptcies in the small cap space were identified ex-ante by falling into one of the lowest deciles of our quality themes—stocks that we specifically exclude in our process.</p><p><img src="https://portalvhdst3l6zspf51mvl.blob.core.windows.net/osam/blogphotos/photo_1736.PNG" width="1045"/></p><p>What is the result? A portfolio with substantial advantages over the benchmark in terms of valuation, returning cash to shareholders, and quality. As of March 31st, the Small Cap Value portfolio was 25% cheaper than the Russell 2000 Value index (measured by Price/Earnings), had a 1,020% higher Shareholder Yield ratio, and 1-year historical EPS growth rate over 7,000% higher than the benchmark. In terms of quality, the portfolio was significantly less reliant on external financing (527% lower), had a 100% higher Cash Flow-to-Debt ratio, and higher use of accruals (27% lower).</p><p><img src="https://portalvhdst3l6zspf51mvl.blob.core.windows.net/osam/blogphotos/photo_1735.PNG" width="442"/></p><p>In these times of market stress, we believe the Small Cap Value strategy is poised for strong performance moving forward by investing in one of the better returning categories out of bear markets, holding companies with significantly better characteristics than the benchmark, and investing at near record-high earnings yield spreads with other assets, implying higher future returns.</p><p>Since March 2004 through March 31st, 2020 the Small Cap Value SMA outperformed the Russell 2000 Value benchmark in 92% of rolling 5-year periods (3.3% Avg. Excess Return), and 95% of rolling 10-year periods (3.3% Avg. Excess Return).</p><p>If you’re interested in learning more about our research, our Small Cap Value strategy is available in both SMA and mutual fund investment vehicles, please reach out to our team.

<p><br/></p><p>March 23, 2020</p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 102, 179);">Blizzard, Winter, or Ice Age</strong></p><p>The past two weeks have been a brutal market blizzard during what is now almost certainly an economic and investing winter.</p><p>Blizzards are defined by extreme volatility and uncertainty—and we’ve had historic amounts of both since February 20th. I believe that to survive a blizzard you must focus on placing each foot in front of the other. Executing your plan or process, reigning in leverage (if applicable), and avoiding blunders in the confusion. We know that price volatility clusters at periodic peaks of uncertainty—these are market blizzards.</p><p><img src="https://portalvhdst3l6zspf51mvl.blob.core.windows.net/osam/blogphotos/photo_1731.PNG" width="782"/></p><p>A winter is a sustained period of equity market drawdown and negative economic growth and rising unemployment—an economic recession. We have faced many winters before, and while the circumstances that trigger a given winter are always somewhat unique, we’ve always recovered and reached new highs in both the economy and the stock market. In a winter, cost structures change and weak hands (even considering bailouts or loans) fold. Winters have been some of the better times to invest cash into equities, by far. </p><p><img src="https://portalvhdst3l6zspf51mvl.blob.core.windows.net/osam/blogphotos/photo_1730.PNG" width="879"/></p><p>We work with a lot of professional financial intermediaries: financial advisors and investment consultants who manage money for their clients. Talking to many of these people over the past two weeks, it is clear that having enough cash on hand is like having a warm fire during winter, and I personally don’t see anything wrong with making asset allocation changes to secure that fire. But full out panic and liquidation has been the <em>clearly wrong </em>strategy in past winters, especially for younger investors or those with years of cash on hand. I think it’s important to remember that the reality isn’t that people sell at market bottoms, markets bottom because everyone sells. With the S&amp;P 500 down nearly 35% from its peak at the time of this writing, we’ve faced the swiftest drawdown on record. For many it has already been incredibly difficult to stick with a long-term equity allocation. Most behavioral investing errors happen in periods of uncertainty like the one we face today.</p><p>That brings us to the largest open question: is this a winter like we’ve faced before, like those visible in the chart above? Each one was hard and painful, but each was followed by a normal spring and summer on the other side. Or is this an ice age? A period more like the Great Depression or other long periods of decline and stagnation? James Bullard at the St. Louis Fed warned recently of the potential for 30% unemployment and a 50% decline in GDP—both significantly worse than the extreme levels of the Great Depression. </p><p>The October 19th, 1918 issue of the <em>Arkansas Gazette </em>highlighted the many ways in which the Spanish flu had decimated local businesses. A department store’s revenues were down 50%; merchants were down 40-70%; businesses were losing an average of $10,000 per day ($133k in 2007 dollars). Demand was up in drug stores, and for certain products like beds, mattresses, and bedsprings<sup>1</sup>.</p><p>Can the same thing that happened in Little Rock in 1918 happen writ large across the entire U.S. (and global) economy and last for years? Without a serious, swift, and aggressive response, it is possible. But the best data that we have suggests it's improbable.</p><p>We are now in one of those scary periods where returns are determined as much by investor behavior and psychology as by fundamental outcomes. In periods of psychological market stress, data, evidence, and process are <em>critical. </em>We turn to that data to build expectations of where we may go from here.</p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 102, 179);">How to Value the Market, and What Returns to Expect From Here</strong></p><p>We are entering a situation in which traditional methods of market valuation may become less useful as business fundamentals fall precipitously. In that type of situation, we think the best way to value the broad market is by measuring its “integrated equity,” which we define as all capital retained and reinvested by companies, properly adjusted for inflation. Here’s what a chart of total integrated equity looks like since 1988. Notice the slight dip for value stocks in the financial crisis (due to write downs and earnings losses). Notice that the measure remains smooth and steady over time, even through periods of deep recession.</p><p><img src="https://portalvhdst3l6zspf51mvl.blob.core.windows.net/osam/blogphotos/photo_1729.PNG" width="624"/></p><p>The cheaper you can buy stocks based on their integrated equity, the better. Here is an update on the estimated future 10-year returns from our price-to-integrated equity calculation. These return predictions have changed drastically since the beginning of the year:</p><p><img src="https://portalvhdst3l6zspf51mvl.blob.core.windows.net/osam/blogphotos/photo_1734.PNG" width="497"/></p><p>We expect 3%/year for growth stocks (still quite low despite the drop) and 13%/year for value stocks. This is the highest prediction we’ve seen for value since the highest ever in March of 2009 (a prediction which proved close to accurate), when the model predicted a return of nearly 17%/year. </p><p><img src="https://portalvhdst3l6zspf51mvl.blob.core.windows.net/osam/blogphotos/photo_1727.PNG" width="676"/></p><p>﻿These are index return predictions. We think that the way Russell builds indexes is not ideal for investing purposes, and that better tailored value strategies will achieve returns significantly higher than the 13%/year which we expect from the index.</p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 102, 179);">How to Build Equity Portfolios Now</strong></p><p>This is where I talk our own book. Normally we don’t comment on how factors look relative to one another in the near term. But there is nothing normal about the markets right now. In fact, we are witnessing relative investment opportunities in smaller, cheaper stocks that we thought we’d never see again after the madness of the tech-bubble in 2000.</p><p>There are many ways we can evaluate the value of smaller cheaper stocks. We can see how cheap they are relative to fixed income yields, we can see how cheap they are versus their own history, and we can see how cheap they are relative to the large growth category of stocks that have led this market cycle since 2009 and <em>thus far</em> have led the market in this drawdown.</p><p>In each case, we see historic readings. As one example, when we compare the earnings yield of the cheapest small stocks (cheapest decile by price-to-earnings) to the most expensive decile of large cap stocks, we see a spread of more than 21%. Following extreme periods like this historically, small value outperformed large growth by 16.8%/year over the subsequent 10 years. </p><p><img src="https://portalvhdst3l6zspf51mvl.blob.core.windows.net/osam/blogphotos/photo_1732.PNG" width="703"/></p><p>We can also compare the earnings yield on small cap stocks (cheapest decile) to the yield on the U.S. government 10-year bond. Most of the time, that spread is between 3-6%. Today it is greater than 20%. Following similar spreads in the past, small value stocks returned an average of 27.9% in the subsequent 10-year period.</p><p><img src="https://portalvhdst3l6zspf51mvl.blob.core.windows.net/osam/blogphotos/photo_1733.PNG" width="701"/></p><p>We use small value here as a simple proxy for many quantitative strategies but must emphasize that we don’t think you should just buy the cheapest decile of stocks. We know that many stocks will suffer huge earnings declines, and so quality and trend remain critically important in any investing modeling process. Since the market peak on February 20th, we’ve seen how important quality can be. In this chart you can see that across our quality factors, low quality stocks have done much worse than the market. We think these factors will remain important from here. </p><p><img src="https://portalvhdst3l6zspf51mvl.blob.core.windows.net/osam/blogphotos/photo_1723.PNG" width="603"/></p><p>Value has been pummeled for years, and now even more acutely for weeks during the COVID market crash. As a result, we are now faced with historic readings and perhaps a historic opportunity. This isn’t to say the market doesn’t have more downside—I have no clue when the blizzard will end. But the data suggests the market as a whole will reward investors, and that it will reward investors focused on quality and valuations even more.</p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 102, 179);">Is the World Going to End?</strong></p><p>Since I’ve been unable to sleep this week, I’ve been rereading Frank Herbert’s <em>Dune</em> at night—the book where we get the famous quote: “fear is the mind killer” (which everyone and their brother is trotting out right now)<em>. </em>It is a damn good passage:</p><p class="ql-indent-2">"I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain."</p><p>We are in a state of global fear and uncertainty. I’ve been asked a lot about what I’ll call “ice age hedges”—through a combination of cash, productive hard assets, or even unproductive scarce assets like gold and bitcoin. I’ll admit that because it's possible (though again, in my view, improbable) that we face a true ice age, I can’t argue with ice age hedges of some type. Personally, I am not buying these things, and am keeping normal cash on hand—but I understand those that are.</p><p>With the country—and world—shut down, can we cross the chasm, help businesses survive the revenue drought, and re-emerge on the other side? I believe that we can. I am an optimist. I believe in the resilience of people, and of this country and the world. I believe that it is hard to bake this resilience and the human response into epidemic models, and so I am optimistic that our response to this menace will curtail the worst-case outcomes, and that we will avoid an ice age.</p><p>I have hope. But as Herbert writes in <em>Dune </em>soon after the famous <em>fear </em>passage, “hope clouds observation.” I agree. Fear is the mind-killer but hope alone is insufficient. We must quickly embrace reality and then seek to improve it. We must focus on the things in our control that we can make go up as prices go down, that we can improve as things devolve. In our case that means perfect execution, more research than ever, more transparent conversations than ever, more information sharing than ever, and a constant assessment and appropriate rebalancing of portfolios. I know everyone else is starting to do the same: asking how they can help, how they can fight, how they can survive and advance, better than before. I promise that everyone at OSAM will be a small part of that fight. </p><p> </p><p><sup>1</sup> <a href="https://www.stlouisfed.org/~/media/files/pdfs/community-development/research-reports/pandemic_flu_report.pdf" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);" target="_blank">https://www.stlouisfed.org/~/media/files/pdfs/community-development/research-reports/pandemic_flu_report.pdf</a></p><p><br/></p><p><strong>﻿General Legal Disclosures &amp; Hypothetical and/or Backtested Results Disclaimer</strong></p><p class="ql-align-justify">The material contained herein is intended as a general market commentary.

<p>March 10, 2020</p><p><br/></p><p>OSAM clients,</p><p>Like everyone we are watching markets and the coronavirus carefully and thinking of ways to be safe and helpful. In acutely painful markets, we have two goals.</p><p>First, to execute our firm’s strategies as flawlessly as we can with a clear emphasis on trading and portfolio management, risk management and rebalancing, and client communication.</p><p>Second, to keep our employees safe, secure, and supported and to do the same for clients to the extent we can, by making their jobs easier if possible. This includes any information or reporting that we can muster that provides perspective for clients. If we can do something to help, tell us.</p><p>In the spirit of sharing information, we provide some very simple looks inside the market below (with data through and including the dramatic sell-off on March 9th).</p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 102, 179);">Factor Performance </strong></p><p>Value has continued its terrible run of performance, dragging many quantitative strategies, ours included. Value strategies that are heavily exposed to Energy and Bank stocks will be the hardest hit, which highlights the need for smart diversification within a factor-based strategy. We’ve always advocated a diversified factor approach, which is helping in this period—but value’s poor performance has taken its toll. Luckily, quality factors have helped especially those which focus on avoiding companies with overleveraged balance sheets and poor earnings trends (right-most two charts below).</p><p>Here are factor returns since the market peak in late February through March 9th. </p><p><img src="https://portalvhdst3l6zspf51mvl.blob.core.windows.net/osam/blogphotos/photo_1718.PNG"/></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 102, 179);">Markets</strong></p><p>We maintain several models internally which serve as guideposts for future market returns. We don’t think that equity returns can be predicted with any real accuracy over horizons less than 5 years, and 10-year projections are much more stable (and still hugely imperfect). Still these models are helpful reminders because they use business fundamentals and market prices as their primary inputs. They don’t take news into account (which is both a strength and a weakness). Both models have changed considerably in recent weeks.</p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 102, 179);">Price-to-Integrated-Equity</strong></p><p>Our price/integrated equity (PIE) return prediction now forecasts a 10-year return of 5%/year for U.S. stocks. That is up massively from the 1%/year prediction as of the end of 2019. The model is very simple: it compares market price to “integrated equity,” which is a growing and inflation adjusted measure of retained earnings. Think of it like a better, cleaner book value. This model is built to not “overreact” to recent changes in corporate earnings, so even when near term earnings take a serious hit as a result of the virus + oil market moves, our return prediction will likely continue to look more attractive now than at the end of last year. </p><p><img src="https://portalvhdst3l6zspf51mvl.blob.core.windows.net/osam/blogphotos/photo_1722.PNG"/></p><p>We also maintain a second internal model which we call “machine valuation,” developed by our co-CIO Chris Meredith and his team. The model is designed to “predict” <em>today’s</em> market value for every company in the U.S. (and therefore broad indexes as well). Think of it as a model to calculate our view of intrinsic value. We can then compare our estimation of intrinsic value with <em>actual </em>market values. We compare the two in the charts below. We will elaborate on these models in a future paper.</p><p>For the Russell 1000, you can see the market has appeared overvalued for some time (mostly because of growth stocks) but that the gap has narrowed considerably in the last month. Perhaps more interesting, the Russell 1000 Value is now trading <em>below</em> our estimate of intrinsic value, while Growth remains considerably elevated. </p><p><img src="https://portalvhdst3l6zspf51mvl.blob.core.windows.net/osam/blogphotos/photo_1721.PNG"/></p><p>Again, models like this are by no means perfect. We offer them here not to say, “don’t panic,” because in the short-term prices are unpredictable and may continue sharply lower. Instead we share these models to highlight that with a long investing horizon, odds are that prices today will lead to better returns than were available just two months ago.</p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 102, 179);">Focus</strong></p><p>We will be using off-market hours to gather and share as much information as we can across topics and asset classes. I personally will release conversations in podcast format with experts from Oil &amp; Gas, corporate credit, and venture capital in the coming days to share what people are seeing on the front lines.</p><p>Most investors have a long-term allocation to stocks because of the overwhelming historical evidence in favor of such an allocation. Our desire to “do something” in a crisis, to offer a port in the storm, is only human. It is during crises when systems and processes tend to break, so while our systems are built for this, our primary focus is taking extra care on execution and support.</p><p><span style="color: black;"> </span></p><p><span style="color: black;">Patrick</span></p><p><span style="color: black;">Chief Executive Officer and Portfolio Manager</span></p><p><br/></p><p><strong>General Legal Disclosures &amp; Hypothetical and/or Backtested Results Disclaimer</strong></p><p class="ql-align-justify">The material contained herein is intended as a general market commentary.

<p><em>While they may not have been known by the same names, many modern investment factors have historical roots stretching back centuries. This series, The Factor Archives, provides historical context on the six factor themes underlying OSAM’s investment </em><a href="https://osam.com/Philosophy-and-Process" style="color: rgb(88, 182, 192);" target="_blank"><strong><em>process</em></strong></a><em style="color: rgb(88, 182, 192);">.</em><em> You can also find other posts from the Factor Archives series </em><a href="https://osam.com/Commentary" style="color: rgb(88, 182, 192);" target="_blank"><strong><em>here</em></strong></a><em>.</em></p><p><img src="https://portalvhdst3l6zspf51mvl.blob.core.windows.net/osam/blogphotos/photo_1598.PNG"/></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 112, 192);">THE FACTOR THESIS </strong></p><p>We believe that price is one of the most predictive determinants of future alpha and try to identify companies trading at cheap prices relative to their sales, earnings, cash flows, and dividends.</p><p>While there are countless value strategies, we take a different approach by using a <em>composite</em> of value factors. Most investors tend to think of factors in singular terms. Price‐to‐earnings, for example, is a <strong><em>single</em></strong> factor for identifying undervalued stocks. Buying cheap companies on any individual value factor is better than a market-cap weighted index (which weights companies based solely off their size), but each have their strengths and weaknesses:</p><p><img src="https://portalvhdst3l6zspf51mvl.blob.core.windows.net/osam/blogphotos/photo_1657.PNG" width="581"/></p><p>The table below demonstrates that using a <strong><em>composite</em></strong> of value factors offers better results than any one value factor in isolation. </p><p><img src="https://portalvhdst3l6zspf51mvl.blob.core.windows.net/osam/blogphotos/photo_1600.PNG"/></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 112, 192);">THE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE</strong></p><p>Our extensive research on Value is summarized in the chart below, which divides our All Stocks Universe into 10 groups based on valuation. Decile 1 represents the group of cheapest stocks; decile 10 shows the most expensive. The evidence is clear. Over the 55‐year study, the cheapest stocks had an excess return of 4.4% annualized, a higher Sharpe Ratio than the All Stocks Universe, and outperformed consistently (79% of the 672 rolling three-year periods).</p><p><img src="https://portalvhdst3l6zspf51mvl.blob.core.windows.net/osam/blogphotos/photo_1656.PNG" width="711"/></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 112, 192);">HISTORICAL ORIGINS: THE MERCHANT PRINCIPLE</strong></p><blockquote class="ql-indent-1">“<em>All merchants or others who are accustomed to speculate in any commodity always take the price this commodity has been for many different years &amp; putting them all together, see what the mean price is, or as they call it the average price – &amp; </em><strong style="color: black;"><em>whenever the commodity they mean to speculate in can be bought under their average price, they think they may safely engage, as they have reason to suppose it will rise in order to come up to its usual price</em></strong><em>… </em><strong style="color: black;"><em>[to buy at high prices would be] absolute madness</em></strong><em>… </em><strong style="color: black;"><em>you may reasonably expect as great a fall to bring it to the average as the careful speculator does a rise when he buys cheap</em></strong><em>.”</em></blockquote><p class="ql-indent-1"><strong>- ­Samuel Bosanquet (April 1773)</strong><sup><strong>1</strong></sup></p><p><span style="color: windowtext;">Despite being applied to a different asset class (commodities), this 18</span><sup style="color: windowtext;">th</sup><span style="color: windowtext;"> century investment principle embodies much of OSAM’s approach to value investing. The excerpt comes from a 1773 letter written by Samuel Bosanquet, a merchant. Writing to his sister that had asked for advice on ‘speculating’ in malt, he stressed that sensible merchants incorporated a Value discipline by only purchasing at below-average prices.</span><sup style="color: windowtext;">2</sup><span style="color: windowtext;"> Additionally, he warned against buying at expensive prices, calling it </span><em style="color: windowtext;">“absolute madness”</em><span style="color: windowtext;"> to do so.</span></p><p><span style="color: windowtext;">Importantly, Samuel also describes ‘mean reversion’, the source of Value’s alpha. For investors, the theory suggests that when prices are </span><em style="color: windowtext;">“below their average”, </em><span style="color: windowtext;">one could </span><em style="color: windowtext;">“safely engage”</em><span style="color: windowtext;"> in speculation because an asset will likely </span><em style="color: windowtext;">“come up to its usual price”</em><span style="color: windowtext;">. This principle also holds true in the inverse scenario:</span></p><blockquote class="ql-indent-1"><em>“You may reasonably expect as great a fall to bring it to the average as the careful speculator does a rise when he buys cheap.”</em><sup><em>3</em></sup></blockquote><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 112, 192);">A HISTORY LESSON: RAILROADS IN THE 19TH CENTURY</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 112, 192);">Chronic Booms and Busts</span></p><p>Financial markets in the 19<sup>th</sup> century can be summarized by a single word: railroads. The <strong>first</strong> ‘Railway Mania’ unfolded in England during the 1840s with fraudulent tycoons like George Hudson, later known as ‘The Railway King’. In 1830, there were only 98 miles of railway track in England, but by 1849, that figure had risen to 6,000 miles.<sup>4</sup> Mania always leads to panic, though, and the market began crumbling in 1846 as the Irish Potato Famine and interest rate hikes decimated railroad operators. By 1850, the value of railway shares had been cut in half.<sup>5</sup></p><p>The <strong>second</strong> railroad boom (but first in America) took shape after the Civil War, as 33,000 miles of railway track was laid across the nation between 1868 – 1873. Speculators poured their money into the burgeoning new industry, but its rapid expansion eventually proved fatal when the Panic of 1873 left many companies unable to service their debts.<sup>6</sup> The 1873 crash was sparked by the failure of Jay Cook &amp; Co., a merchant bank, and the ripple effects spread as banks suspended cash payments. The situation became so dire that the U.S. stock market was temporarily closed for the first time in history.<sup>7</sup></p><blockquote class="ql-indent-1"><em>“In the railroad industry, a number of other railroads were forced, in the face of a declining bond market and decreased interest in railroad bonds (particularly in Europe), to default on their debt. </em><strong><em>All told, nearly a quarter of railroad companies with outstanding bonds engaged in at least a partial default during this period</em></strong><em>.”</em><sup><em>8</em></sup></blockquote><p>Yet just a few years later, signs of investor amnesia emerged as aggressive railroad expansion and speculation broke out for a <strong>third</strong> time. In the 1880s, an astonishing 71,000 miles of railway track was built, and the financial industry kept in step by raising capital from the sea of speculators willing to part with their money. Then, as always, the railroad boom came to a brutal halt. The Panic of 1893 bankrupted many of the largest railroads, including Northern Pacific, Union Pacific, and the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe. Reports estimate that some 500 banks and 15,000 businesses were wiped out.<sup>9</sup> In 1894, almost 25% of railroads were bankrupt.<sup>10</sup></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 112, 192);">The Boy Who Cried Wolf </span></p><p>As the economist Jack Kenneth Galbraith put it:</p><blockquote class="ql-indent-1"><em>“Nothing in the nineteenth century is more remarkable than the way </em><strong><em>men forgot the last railroad debacle and proceeded to lose money in the next</em></strong><em>.”</em><sup><em>11</em></sup></blockquote><p>After experiencing two railroad booms and busts in three decades, American investors were wary of railroad stocks. With a quarter of the industry bankrupt and leading operators in receivership, their skepticism was clearly warranted.</p><p>The great irony, though, was that just when American investors finally learned their lesson in avoiding railroad speculation, railroad stocks went on to post incredibly strong returns as a result of improving earnings and business fundamentals. However, the public’s aversion to railroad stocks was so vehement that even when demonstrable evidence of rising earnings was presented, it fell on deaf ears. Most investors would not dare risk their capital in railroad stocks after 1893. Thomas Gibson, a contemporary investor and author, wrote:</p><blockquote class="ql-indent-1"><em>“</em><strong><em>These opportunities are seldom taken advantage of by the public because of the prejudice and odium inspired by bankruptcy</em></strong><em>. What the uninitiated fail to see is that bad management, bad financing or dishonest practices, or a combination of these evils, are responsible for receivership in almost all cases, and that a drastic reorganization removes the abuses without curtailing the territory or prejudicing the prospects of the rehabilitated road.”</em><sup><em>12</em></sup></blockquote><p>This prejudice meant investors missed a fantastic opportunity to purchase dramatically improving businesses with steadily rising earnings at cheap valuations. Gibson notes that <strong><em>“both the earnings and the securities of reorganized roads have advanced much more rapidly than those of the sound and solvent properties.”</em>,</strong><em> </em>which is displayed below:<sup>13</sup></p><p><img src="https://portalvhdst3l6zspf51mvl.blob.core.windows.net/osam/blogphotos/photo_1602.PNG"/></p><p>The fiercely negative view of reorganized railroads like the Atchison after 1893 is characterized by one journalist definitively stating that Atchison was <em>“hopelessly bankrupt”</em>.<sup>14</sup> Another article argued:</p><blockquote class="ql-indent-1"><em>“The ‘Railroad Gazette’ of New York takes </em><strong><em>a decidedly unfavorable view of the plan for the reorganization of the Atchison Railway</em></strong><em>. It objects that ‘the control of the railroad is left in the hands of the two classes of stockholders, the preferred slightly in the majority, but </em><strong><em>a preferred stock which is not likely ever to earn honestly more than 2% dividends</em></strong><em>, and </em><strong><em>a common stock which will never earn anything</em></strong><em> honestly’… in the opinion of our contemporary, </em><strong><em>an old-fashioned foreclosure, wiping out fictitious values, would have been the most merciful </em></strong><em>in the end.”</em><sup>15</sup></blockquote><p>The bias against railroad stocks became problematic as it clouded investors’ decision-making process since, in reality, Atchison’s reorganization was progressing very well. The company was significantly improving as management cut costs, made routes more efficient by transporting larger loads on fewer trains, and closed redundant lines. </p><blockquote class="ql-indent-1"><em>“In the case of the Atchison there was an </em><strong><em>increase in the year's traffic receipts of $5,591,000</em></strong><em>, while the </em><strong><em>working expenditure was actually $85,000 less</em></strong><em> than for 1898-1899, the </em><strong><em>cost of maintaining the road and structures exhibiting a decline</em></strong><em> of as much as $1,318,000, </em><strong><em>owing, it is stated, to a considerable reduction in the train mileage, rendered possible by the better loading of cars and the lengthening of trains</em></strong><em>.”</em><sup>16</sup></blockquote><p>All this, of course, had a meaningful impact on the bottom line:<sup>17</sup></p><p><img src="https://portalvhdst3l6zspf51mvl.blob.core.windows.net/osam/blogphotos/photo_1603.PNG"/></p><p>There reached a point where investors could no longer ignore the obvious and had to recognize that their prejudice against railroad stocks may have been overly harsh. In 1898, as stock prices began to recover, one commentator stated:</p><blockquote class="ql-indent-1"><em>“The upward movement is not at all surprising, for </em><strong><em>the shrinkage in market valuations from which the rally has taken place was in many cases utterly excessive</em></strong><em>.”</em><sup>18</sup></blockquote><p>Railroad stocks crept back into favor and went on a tear from 1898 to 1901. In fact, reorganized railroads were the strongest performers. Gibson wrote: </p><blockquote class="ql-indent-1"><em>“As to stock prices, if we assume that about $10,000 was in 1898 devoted to the purchase of either of the two standard dividend-paying roads which were at that time considered the highest grade stocks on the list, as compared with an equal sum placed in the stocks of three reorganized roads, the stocks being disposed of in 1901, we get the following results…”</em><sup>19</sup></blockquote><p><img src="https://portalvhdst3l6zspf51mvl.blob.core.windows.net/osam/blogphotos/photo_1604.PNG"/></p><p>However, as the author points out:<strong><em> </em></strong></p><blockquote class="ql-indent-1"><em>“If any prophet had been bold enough to suggest in 1898 that Baltimore and Ohio, Atchison and Northern Pacific would in three short years be dividend payers selling around or above par </em><strong><em>he would have been popularly considered a fit subject for an inquirendo lunatic </em>[lunatic assessment]</strong><em>.”</em><sup>20</sup></blockquote><p>Some 30 years earlier, a different investor made an equally harsh description of value stocks, calling them <em>“rubbish”</em> and <em>“unconsidered trifles”</em>:<sup>21</sup></p><p><img src="https://portalvhdst3l6zspf51mvl.blob.core.windows.net/osam/blogphotos/photo_1595.PNG"/></p><p>As the second excerpt notes, value stocks <em>“should not be neglected”</em>, as <em>“circumstances favorable to their locality or character, shall again bring them into public favor.”</em> Again, this is describing mean reversion.</p><p>While an investment strategy focused on finding “rubbish” stocks sounds like sheer lunacy, it is also the reason it works. Value investing is a profitable and time-tested strategy because these “rubbish” stocks often turn out to be good companies that were thrown away too quickly, or by mistake. As the market realizes its error and stock prices revert to their fair value, value investors reap the rewards.</p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 112, 192);">The Lesson for Value Investors</span></p><p>In such challenging times for value investors and allocators, historical context is vital for good decision-making. Despite the deluge of articles claiming “value investing no longer works”, there is a reason that this approach has existed for centuries, with the first value fund opening in 1779.<sup>22</sup> Within the roughly 250-year history of value investing, the current 13-year bout of underperformance is a blip. In fact, <a href="https://osam.com/Commentary/value-is-dead-long-live-value" target="_blank">a previous OSAM paper</a> discusses a similar period of sustained underperformance from 1926 to 1941, with Value stocks going on to significantly outperform.</p><p>However, when personally experiencing challenging market environments or events, it’s easy to believe “it’s actually different this time.” In the vast majority of cases, though, it’s not.</p><p>In the 19<sup>th</sup> century, value investors were deemed lunatics for buying railroad stocks after a series of railroad booms and busts. Especially those that were in receivership just a few years prior. What they noticed and that market had not yet figured out, however, was that the businesses behind these stocks were improving. These ‘lunatics’ were eventually proven right and had the returns to back it up. In 2020, value investors can also seem crazy, and after thirteen years of underperformance, this is understandable. However, value investing has weathered market forces for centuries. So yes, the market may be “different this time”, but purchasing stocks at discounted prices still makes sense to us.</p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 112, 192);">A BRIEF HISTORY OF VALUATION</strong></p><p><span style="color: windowtext;">For centuries, value investors have understood the relationship between a stock’s valuation, and future returns. What has changed is </span><strong style="color: windowtext;"><em>how</em></strong><span style="color: windowtext;"> investors decide if a company is “cheap”. In </span><em style="color: windowtext;">Valuation of Equity Securities: History, Theory and Application</em><span style="color: windowtext;">, Geoffrey Poitras marks the significant transitions in equity valuation. A few key moments are outlined below:</span><sup style="color: windowtext;">23</sup></p><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 112, 192);">Before 1850: Fixed Income Methods</span></p><blockquote class="ql-indent-1"><em style="color: windowtext;">“</em><strong style="color: windowtext;"><em>The earliest issues of equity securities involved the use of valuation methods developed for fixed income securities to determine the ‘intrinsick’ value of the stock</em></strong><em style="color: windowtext;">… The shortcoming with using fixed income methods to value common stock is that the dividend is not fixed over time.”</em></blockquote><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 112, 192);">Mid-19th Century: Introduction of Discounted Cash Flows (DCF)</span></p><blockquote class="ql-indent-1"><em style="color: windowtext;">“Advanced valuation methodologies permitted the future cash flows associated with the asset being valued to vary over time… </em><strong style="color: windowtext;"><em>a U.K. mining engineer, William Armstrong (1811–1896), used discounted cash flow methods to value mining company issues and mining leases</em></strong><em style="color: windowtext;">… Todhunter (1901) modelled the common stock price using a perpetuity with a constant growth rate, determining the pricing solution with an infinite number of dividend payments.”</em></blockquote><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 112, 192);">Entering the 20th Century: Using Dividends</span></p><blockquote class="ql-indent-1"><em style="color: windowtext;">“</em><strong style="color: windowtext;"><em>The dividend yield was considered to be the most important measure of equity security value, especially for investment grade stocks… The convention was to measure the value of common stock relative to bonds</em></strong><em style="color: windowtext;">: being the most junior of all securities with the greatest variability of cash flow common stock required the highest yield among the securities on offer from a given corporation…</em> <strong style="color: windowtext;"><em>Dividends paid were the most visible and reliable source of information about firm performance.</em></strong><em style="color: windowtext;">”</em></blockquote><p><span style="color: rgb(0, 112, 192);">1924: Transition from Dividends to Earnings Based Models </span></p><blockquote class="ql-indent-1"><em style="color: windowtext;">“Smith (Common Stocks as Long-Term Investments) arguably </em><strong style="color: windowtext;"><em>marks the beginning of the transition from equity valuation based on dividend yields to equity valuation based on earnings…</em></strong><em style="color: windowtext;"> Smith changed the perception of the importance of earnings relative to dividends… </em><strong style="color: windowtext;"><em>superior presentation of accounting information by United States</em></strong><em style="color: windowtext;"> as compared to U.K. and European companies, e.g</em><strong style="color: windowtext;"><em>., in the reporting of consolidated versus unconsolidated earnings, also facilitated the use of valuations based on earnings as opposed to dividends.”</em></strong></blockquote><p><span style="color: windowtext;">Since superior accounting information prompted this last transition from dividends to earnings, we know that earnings-based valuation metrics have remained popular, with Price-to-Earnings (P/E) being one of the most widely used. </span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 112, 192);">THE PROBLEMS WITH PRICE TO BOOK</strong></p><p>While valuation metrics and models have evolved over time as accounting information, data, company profiles, and markets change, there is one value factor that has curiously lived on, despite becoming increasingly irrelevant. This vestigial factor is Price-to-Book. In fact, the problems with book value have been highlighted since at <em>least</em> 1935:<sup>24</sup></p><p><img src="https://portalvhdst3l6zspf51mvl.blob.core.windows.net/osam/blogphotos/photo_1596.PNG"/></p><p>Alarmingly, however, the majority of value-oriented strategies incorporate this outdated value factor. This is particularly stark in the case of Value ETFs:</p><p><img src="https://portalvhdst3l6zspf51mvl.blob.core.windows.net/osam/blogphotos/photo_1605.PNG" width="708"/></p><p>As the previous section showed, new accounting standards and information spurred the transition from dividend-based to earnings-based valuations in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century. A similar dynamic has unfolded in recent years, but many investors have stuck with the outdated model.</p><p><span style="color: windowtext;">In OSAM’s white paper, </span><a href="https://osam.com/Commentary/negative-equity-veiled-value-and-the-erosion-of-price-to-book" target="_blank"><em>Negative Equity, Veiled Value, and the Erosion of Price-to-Book</em></a><span style="color: windowtext;">, Travis Fairchild demonstrates how book value is not keeping up with the times and highlights similar points to those in the 1935 book above.</span></p><blockquote class="ql-indent-1"><em style="color: windowtext;">“Balance sheets prepared under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) are doing an increasingly poor job of reflecting the value of shareholders equity</em><strong style="color: windowtext;"><em>. Recent trends have tended to bias assets well below market value which has led to the increased frequency of negative equity and Veiled Value stocks</em></strong><em style="color: windowtext;">. Those tend to fall into three main categories…</em></blockquote><blockquote class="ql-indent-4"><em style="color: windowtext;">1) </em><strong style="color: windowtext;"><em>Understated Intangible Assets:</em></strong><em style="color: windowtext;"> Brand names, human capital, advertising, and research and development (R&amp;D) are rarely represented on the balance sheet</em></blockquote><blockquote class="ql-indent-4"><em style="color: windowtext;">2</em><strong style="color: windowtext;"><em>) Understated Long Term Assets</em></strong><em style="color: windowtext;">: Assets are often depreciated faster than their useful lives</em></blockquote><blockquote class="ql-indent-4"><em style="color: windowtext;">3) </em><strong style="color: windowtext;"><em>Buybacks and Dividends</em></strong><em style="color: windowtext;">: When buybacks and dividends exceed net income, they create a decrease in equity which can accelerate distortions”</em></blockquote><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 112, 192);">WHAT NOW? THE FUTURE OF VALUE</strong></p><p><span style="color: windowtext;">Value investing is a centuries old philosophy that is constantly evolving. The key to remaining a successful value investor, therefore, is constantly researching, validating, and testing value factors and strategies so that your approach does not become outdated like Price-to-Book. As new data sets and technology becomes available, the opportunity for alpha within the value factor grows.</span></p><p><span style="color: windowtext;">At OSAM, we have followed this guiding principle through the following projects and insights:</span></p><ul><li><span style="color: rgb(0, 112, 192);">Machine Learning</span><span style="color: windowtext;">: Used to construct our Deep History database, which added 30 years of history for fundamental analysis that was previously unavailable. Conducting further research in areas like machine valuation, predicting earnings, and more.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgb(0, 112, 192);">OSAM Research Partners</span><span style="color: windowtext;">: “Jesse Livermore<sup class="infoIcon" style="font-style:normal;" title="Pseudonym">+</sup>’s” research on corporate profitability led to an improvement in how we measure a company’s growth profile. To summarize: free cash flow works well alongside side earnings as the “profit” measure inside of factors like return on capital, per share growth, and profitability breakouts (above or below a company’s historical trendline).</span></li><li><span style="color: rgb(0, 112, 192);">Corporate Innovation</span><span style="color: windowtext;">: By conducting an in-depth research project on patent data, we found that monitoring and applying innovation factors can give investors insight into leading indicators of potential fundamental growth and stock performance not captured by traditional financial metrics used today.</span></li></ul><p><span style="color: windowtext;">Value investing has a long history, a bright future, and OSAM maintains its conviction in the factor going forward.</span></p><h3>Appendix</h3><p><sup>1</sup> Manchester University, Methodist Archives and Research Centre, MAM FL1.8/10</p><p><sup>2</sup> Anne L.

<p>O’Shaughnessy Quarterly Investor Letter Q4 2019</p><p>January 8, 2020</p><p>Dear Investor,</p><p>In 2019, we completed more research than in any prior year, built and launched <a href="https://canvas.osam.com/" target="_blank">Canvas</a><a href="https://canvas.osam.com/" style="color: rgb(5, 99, 193);" target="_blank"><sup><u>TM</u></sup></a>, and shared 13 papers and over 50 podcasts. We grew our team and operated with more focus than in any year I can remember. As of the end of the year, we are managing $5.7B in assets under management, across 2,508 accounts for individual and institutional investors.</p><p>I joked at our holiday party that I felt like I aged 5 years in 2019—but I wear the age with pride. I’ve never learned so much in a single year, and I’m confident everyone on the team could say the same. More than anything, I will remember 2019 for how hard and efficiently the OSAM team worked. They redefined what I thought was possible in a single year.</p><p>In this letter I’ll discuss where we stand in markets at year end, and discuss what we built and learned at OSAM during the year.</p><p><strong style="color: rgb(5, 99, 193);">Market Observations and Outlook</strong></p><p>In 2019, growth beat value yet again. But the reasons this year were different. Most of growth’s strong run vs. value this past decade has been the result of better business results. Growth stocks simply trounced value stocks when it came to fundamental earnings growth. But in 2019, the story was flipped. This year growth’s dominance was fueled entirely by multiple expansion and <em>not </em>by good business results or return of capital to shareholders (where value fared much better).</p><p>As a result, at the end of 2019, growth stocks were trading at expensive multiples with high and rising expectations. Value stocks traded at moderate multiples with low and falling expectations.</p><p>Thanks in large part to the multiple expansion in growth stocks, the overall market has grown more expensive and is priced for weaker returns over the next decade than we saw over the previous decade. We believe in value as a structural strategy (it is one of 6 primary factor categories and one of 3 primary selection factors that we use) but are especially excited at its prospects given where value stocks are positioned relative to growth and the rest of the market.</p><p class="ql-align-center">***</p><p>Traditional factor investing had a rough year. While we outperformed slightly in our largest strategy (“Market Leaders Value”) relative to the benchmark, the rest of our strategies struggled. This grid shows the decile performance of our six primary factor themes. As a factor investor, you’d prefer that the first decile of each factor outperform. But during 2019, every single “highest decile” factor portfolio performed poorly. </p><p><img src="https://portalvhdst3l6zspf51mvl.blob.core.windows.net/osam/blogphotos/photo_1526.PNG" width="633"/></p><p>Digging a bit deeper to see how factors interacted, we see more evidence of it being a hard year for quants. Across available history, a better place to invest was in stocks with cheap valuations <em>and</em> strong momentum. But in 2019, the category of “cheap momentum” delivered a +16.1% return—the lowest of any valuation/momentum segment. Expensive momentum stocks did much better and delivered a +35.3% return in 2019. </p><p><img src="https://portalvhdst3l6zspf51mvl.blob.core.windows.net/osam/blogphotos/photo_1525.PNG" width="749"/></p><p><img src="https://portalvhdst3l6zspf51mvl.blob.core.windows.net/osam/blogphotos/photo_1524.PNG" width="752"/></p><p>The table below segregates Russell style index performance for 2019 into three simple return buckets: return from dividends and buybacks (“return of capital”), return from fundamental growth, and return from multiple expansion.</p><p><img src="https://portalvhdst3l6zspf51mvl.blob.core.windows.net/osam/blogphotos/photo_1523.PNG" width="914"/></p><p>Value stocks delivered better fundamental performance (-1.22% contribution for value vs. -3.53% for growth) <em>and</em><strong><em> </em></strong>delivered positive returns via dividends and buybacks (adding +3.58%), while the growth index diluted shareholders (detracting -3.64%). This means that had changing valuation multiples not affected returns and we instead only cared about business growth and return of capital; the Russell 1000 Value would have outperformed the Russell 1000 Growth by 9.5% in 2019.</p><p>But multiple expansion matters, and for the Russell 1000 Growth, multiple expansion contributed a whopping 43.7% to returns. Value multiples expanded too, but the effect was half as strong, boosting returns by 24.0%. Add it all up, and despite much weaker <em>business</em> performance, growth still beat value by 10.1%.</p><p><img src="https://portalvhdst3l6zspf51mvl.blob.core.windows.net/osam/blogphotos/photo_1527.PNG" width="712"/></p><p>When we look closely at the widening valuation spread between cheap and expensive segments of the market, we see that that it’s based on increased optimism around the future prospects of growth stocks and increased pessimism around the future prospects of value stocks. To illustrate this disparity, the charts below show the average estimates for long-term earnings growth collected by IBES. Analysts are expecting growth companies (those in the Russell 1000 Growth index) to grow their earnings at ~20% per year over the long-term, and for value companies to grow their earnings at only ~7% per year. </p><p><img src="https://portalvhdst3l6zspf51mvl.blob.core.windows.net/osam/blogphotos/photo_1528.PNG" width="832"/></p><p>As you can see, the spread between the estimates has recently blown out, and now sits within striking distance of the March 2000 extreme: </p><p><img src="https://portalvhdst3l6zspf51mvl.blob.core.windows.net/osam/blogphotos/photo_1530.PNG" width="831"/></p><p>Growth dominated the 2010s because of great real business performance, but now, after a bad year for the growth companies themselves, analysts have the second highest set of <em>future</em> earnings expectations for growth stocks (both in absolute terms and relative to value) since 2000.</p><p><strong style="color: rgb(5, 99, 193);">What About the Broad Market?</strong></p><p>As the chart below illustrates, our updated in-house 10-year point estimate for the U.S. market’s nominal total return fell during the year, and now sits at ~1.5% annualized, which would mean a ~16% total return over the next decade.<a href="about:blank" target="_blank"><sup>1</sup></a> If this estimate turns out to be accurate (it might not), the next decade will end up being one of the weakest periods for equity returns on record.<a href="about:blank" target="_blank"><sup>2</sup></a> We are generally skeptical of forecasts in markets, and offer this only as a strategic guide or starting point for forming return expectations—it does not affect our investing strategies in any way (which we expect to perform considerably better than the overall market).</p><p><img src="https://portalvhdst3l6zspf51mvl.blob.core.windows.net/osam/blogphotos/photo_1529.PNG" width="957"/></p><p>On a more positive note, there is some evidence that the corporate earnings that feed into market valuation measures, ours included, are <em>understated</em> relative to history. If true, this observation would mean that we should expect future returns to be somewhat higher than the returns that markets at similar valuations in the past ended up producing.</p><p>Why are earnings today understated relative to history? In part because companies today spend less on capital expenditures (a deferred expense that gets smoothed out over a number of years) and more on research and development (a current expense that hits earnings immediately, with no deferral). So, today’s earnings tend to be “sandbagged” relative to the past.<a href="about:blank" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);" target="_blank"><sup>3</sup></a></p><p><img src="https://portalvhdst3l6zspf51mvl.blob.core.windows.net/osam/blogphotos/photo_1519.PNG" width="940"/></p><p>The message is still the same: long-term returns for the overall U.S. equity market are likely to be weak going forward. This point has been made for some time now, and it reflects a reality that many of us have already come to terms with. Unfortunately, it doesn’t answer the real question, which is the question of what to do with a portfolio, right now. Equities may be priced for low returns, but other asset classes, most notably fixed-income and cash, are priced for even <em>lower</em> returns.</p><p>What, then, should investors do? We think that the answer is to do what successful investors did in the early 2000s, which was to focus on the opportunities presented inside the market. We believe that value stocks are providing an opportunity today that is similar (though not identical) to the opportunity that they presented then.</p><p>I’m fully invested in equities. But the price (multiple) that I pay for my portfolio today, measured relative to earnings, sales, and free cash flow is significantly lower than the price of the Russell 1000. My OSAM Canvas portfolio, which represents nearly all my public equity exposure, trades at 15x earnings and 9x cash flow. The Russell 1000 trades at 23x earnings and 14.7x cash flow. My total portfolio shareholder yield is 5.1%. The Russell 1000’s is only 2.6%. I share these points because these kinds of value-based considerations have historically been useful predictors of future returns. There’s a very real opportunity right now to improve upon the returns of the broad market using systematic strategies that incorporate them.</p><p>The bottom line: we believe in equities and systematic strategies for the long haul and believe that value is set up for strong returns relative to growth but believe that expectations for equity market return over the next decade should be tempered. </p><p><strong style="color: rgb(5, 99, 193);">Canvas</strong></p><p>Our goal with <a href="https://canvas.osam.com/" target="_blank">Canvas</a> is to supercharge the advisers who use it by making <strong>fully customized portfolios</strong> possible for the first time. Funds (mutual funds and ETFs) dominated the last 100 years of investing. Fully customized portfolios—unique strategies built to suit each investor, managed inside individual separate accounts—will dominate the next 100. Fully customized portfolios are possible through the combination of research and technology, which is where we excel. Canvas created this category, and we will continue to lead it.</p><p>We began building Canvas at the beginning of this year, launched it publicly in September at the Wealth/Stack conference, and began trading customized Canvas portfolios for clients in early November. </p><p><img src="https://portalvhdst3l6zspf51mvl.blob.core.windows.net/osam/blogphotos/photo_1518.PNG" width="524"/></p><p>Following the prescient advice of Chetan Puttagunta (a General Partner at Benchmark Capital and soon-to-be a podcast guest), we decided that we’d launch the product by finding a small group of early partners—what we call our “First 10”—and then close the door to new firms, which we have since done.</p><p>These firms are all independent registered investment advisers, which manage an average of $2.2 billion. They are all over the country, with different firm structures and client types, so that we can learn from each.</p><p>Two interesting observations since our first client account opened on November 5<sup>th</sup>:</p><p>First, of the First 10 firms, no two firms have the same basic strategy settings (asset allocation, or balance between passive and factor exposure). This means each RIA is using Canvas to build <em>their</em> firm’s investment philosophy into systematic strategies in unique ways.</p><p>Second, across the new individual Canvas portfolios we’ve opened so far, the majority have entirely unique strategy settings, tailored to the individual investor. So even within specific RIA firms, Canvas is being used to build different strategies for different individual clients. Already there are two levels of customization—firm level and client level—which is exactly what we designed Canvas to do.</p><p>Canvas is a new product but also a new mindset for us at OSAM. Seeing customization happening real time has shifted our orientation from fixed to flexible strategy and product design. We’ve realized that the idea of tailoring systematic strategies to the end investor is a powerful concept, and we believe it is the future of systematic asset management for both individuals and institutions.</p><p>Once we feel we’ve refined and expanded Canvas’s capabilities based on time spent with the First 10, we will open the gates and do the same thing again: find another cohort of partners, hopefully with more unique problems to be solved, and iterate the platform.</p><p><strong style="color: rgb(5, 99, 193);">Lessons from Building Software</strong></p><p>I think everyone would benefit from building client facing software. Doing so helps you understand your clients in the deepest way possible. In the past, when we’ve asked clients what problems they are trying to solve, we didn’t get actionable answers. In sharp contrast, when we demo a flexible software chassis like Canvas to prospects, they project their real problems onto the software in the form of the question: “Can it also do x?”</p><p>We track the list of these questions carefully, and they have heavily influenced our product roadmap. Critically, we aren’t just asking customers what they want and building it—not at all. Instead we are combining our distinct understanding of systematic investing strategies and software and laying it alongside our First 10’s deep understanding of their clients to arrive at the most valuable new additions or refinements to the Canvas platform.</p><p>We’ve also learned that ease and efficiency of use is critical—a mindset which bleeds into other non-software work. Here’s Chetan describing how a business user thinks about whether to adopt a new software system:</p><blockquote class="ql-indent-1"><em>"This [new software] is yet another system that your prospective client has to interact with. Ultimately, what you deliver from your software is not actually your customer’s job. Your customer has an end goal. If they’re in sales, they’re trying to sell more. If they’re in marketing, they’re trying to market more. If they’re in financial services, perhaps they’re trying to lend more. If they’re in manufacturing, they’re trying to manufacture more. There is some end goal that your customer is trying to achieve and becoming proficient in your software system is *not*the end goal of your customer, so aligning proficiency of your software solution to your customer’s end goal is critical."</em></blockquote><p>This makes me think of one of my favorite books, by Steven Pressfield called Nobody Wants to Read Your Sh*t. As Pressfield writes,</p><blockquote class="ql-indent-1"><em>"Nobody wants to read your sh*t. What’s the answer? 1) Streamline your message. Focus it and pare it down to its simplest, clearest, easiest-to-understand form. When you understand that nobody wants to read your sh*t, your mind becomes powerfully concentrated. You begin to understand that writing/reading is, above all, a transaction. The reader donates his time and attention, which are supremely valuable commodities. In return, you the writer must give him something worthy of his gift to you."</em></blockquote><p>It’s helpful to remember no one wants to adopt your thing...unless it’s extremely useful to help them achieve <em>their</em> end goal. Take the above paragraph and substitute your area of work (software building or otherwise) for “writing/reading,” and you have a powerful business lesson—one we are trying to follow at OSAM.</p><p><strong style="color: rgb(5, 99, 193);">Research + Factors</strong></p><p>We’ve been refining our core factors—value, momentum, business quality, and shareholder yield—for nearly three decades. We expect to continue to improve on these core factors, and we did so in 2019.</p><p>Following the deep exploration of corporate profitability by OSAM Research Partner “<a href="https://osam.com/Commentary/the-earnings-mirage" target="_blank">Jesse Livermore<sup class="infoIcon" style="font-style:normal;" title="Pseudonym">+</sup></a>”, we completed a research project which led to an improvement in how we measure a company’s growth profile. We updated our production models with this new signal, which represented an improvement over our old method of measuring profitability and growth.</p><p>Without going into the somewhat painstaking detail on the factor research, the headline is free cash flow works brilliantly alongside side earnings as the “profit” measure inside of factors like return on capital, per share growth, and profitability breakouts (above or below a company’s historical trendline).</p><p>This year, we also made massive learning leaps as a team in categories outside of the core factors. Specifically, in the areas of corporate innovation, machine learning, portfolio optimization, risk modeling, after tax returns &amp; tax alpha, and ESG.</p><p>We are excited about ongoing projects working deeper into risk modeling, transaction cost modeling, portfolio optimization, and “greenfield” factor research like innovation modeling. Each area of research represents a way for us to build more efficient and unique factor strategies for clients.</p><p><strong style="color: rgb(5, 99, 193);">Acts of Kindness</strong></p><p>At the end of every podcast, I ask the guest for the kindest thing that anyone has ever done for them. The answers make me emotional every time, and serve as great reminders for how to live.</p><p>In the spirit of that question, here are the acts of kindness in business for which I’m thankful this year.</p><p>I am most thankful for the OSAM team and their families, our research partners, and our investing clients. I don’t have space in this letter to detail the number of new skills the team picked up this year. My favorite part of the environment we’ve built is the curiosity and collaboration evident in every interaction. This year has been a business adventure beyond all maps.</p><p>I am thankful to Brent Beshore, Bill Hessert, and Jeremiah Lowin for their constant advice and support. Brent is a business partner twice over (via his firm’s <a href="https://www.adventur.es/about-our-firm" target="_blank">permanent equity fund</a> and an investor retreat that he and I co-host called <a href="https://www.capitalcamp.com/event" target="_blank">Capital Camp</a>, but he is also a dear friend who has forgotten more about business than I’ll ever know. Bill is a friend who I call for just about everything. He is insanely smart and adventurous. I joke that I’ve been waiting since 1<sup>st </sup> grade to invest in a company run by Jeremiah, and we finally got the privilege to <a href="http://investorfieldguide.com/machinelearning/" target="_blank">do so</a>. Watching him build a company has blown me away and saved me so much time because he’s generous in sharing what he is learning at the frontier of technology.</p><p>I am thankful for the lessons Graham Duncan, Sam Hinkie, and Jim O’Shaughnessy have taught me about people and trust. Sam maintains a folder he calls “stunning colleagues.” Graham says, “talent is the best asset class.” My father delivers on what he commits to every single time. Each has taught and <em>shown</em> me how to invest in people and in relationships.</p><p>I am thankful for the example set by Bill Gurley, Josh Wolfe, Michael Mauboussin, Bethany McLean, Zack Kanter, Daniel Ek, and Sarah Tavel. Their thinking—often shared in writing—reveals bottomless curiosity about business and investing. I’ve already mentioned Chetan Puttagunta, but I need to say again how thankful I am for his advice and enthusiasm. He has been a personal Yoda for me as we’ve tackled the world of software.</p><p>Nothing excites me more than the prospect of decades of compounding ahead, working with these people and more like them to build what we believe will be the best investing platform on the planet.</p><p><strong style="color: rgb(5, 99, 193);">Continuing the OSAM Way</strong></p><p>One of my favorite questions to ask other investors is “what part of what you do would be hardest for others to copy, even if they knew exactly what you were doing?”</p><p>Our answers to that question are the topics explored in this letter. These areas fit into our operating philosophy: <strong>learn</strong> (research, research partners), <strong>build</strong> (Canvas, investing strategies), <strong>share</strong> (content), <strong>repeat</strong>.</p><p>What is common across these examples is slow, organic compounding. None of these assets could be air-dropped in, and they all feed off each other. These distinct areas of competitive advantage are working and have long runways, so it is unlikely that we launch a new large-scale effort in 2020. We’ve experimented enough over the years to know traction when we see it. We look forward to learning with you in 2020.</p><p>Happy New Year!</p><p><img src="https://portalvhdst3l6zspf51mvl.blob.core.windows.net/osam/blogphotos/photo_1517.PNG"/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Patrick W.

The fit is also in-sample, so the future correlation cannot be projected out with anywhere near the degree of tightness seen in the chart. Finally, we have to remember that forecasting methodologies based on valuation can only be accurately applied over very long horizons--longer than many of us are able to allocate based on. Today's valuation tells us very little about what's likely to happen to the market in the near-to-medium term.</p><p><sup style="color: gray; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">2</sup> In this chart, we show current period R&amp;D, depreciation, and capex as a percentage of the sum of the absolute values of those quantities. We show the capex percentage as negative to contrast it with the R&amp;D and depreciation. The black line shows the sum of R&amp;D, depreciation and (negative) capex. When it's positive, the implication is that current expensing of investment is outweighing deferred expensing, increasing the chances that reported earnings are being understated. When the line is negative, the implication is that deferred expensing of investment is outweighing current expensing, increasing the chances that reported earnings are being overstated.</p><p><sup style="color: gray; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">3</sup> Also Because inflation, which upwardly distorts earnings from an accounting perspective, is lower than in the past.</p><p><br/></p><p><strong>General Legal Disclosures &amp; Hypothetical and/or Backtested Results Disclaimer</strong></p><p class="ql-align-justify">The material contained herein is intended as a general market commentary.

Historical performance results for investment indices, benchmarks, and/or categories have been provided for general informational/comparison purposes only, and generally do not reflect the deduction of transaction and/or custodial charges, the deduction of an investment management fee, nor the impact of taxes, the incurrence of any or which would have the effect of decreasing historical performance results. When the securities to be purchased and held using the CANVAS™ platform include exchange-traded funds, including fixed-income funds, the investor will be subject to additional expenses imposed at the fund level; the CANVAS™ platform seeks to estimate these expenses but may not do so precisely. An investor’s account holdings will generally not correspond directly to any comparative indices or categories.</span></p><p class="ql-align-justify"><span style="color: rgb(60, 70, 71);">The CANVAS™ platform reports historical performance information for Strategies compiled by OSAM. These performance figures reflect hypothetical, back-tested results; thus, they represent the retroactive performance of simulated portfolios. As such, the corresponding results have inherent limitations, including that: (a) the results do not reflect actual trading using investor assets, but were achieved by means of the theoretical retroactive application of the devised Strategy, certain aspects of which may have been designed with the benefit of hindsight; (b) back-tested performance may not reflect the impact that any material market or economic factors might have had on the investment professional’s use of the hypothetical portfolio if the portfolio had been used during the period to manage actual investor assets; and (c) the back-tested performance of any Strategy does not reflect trading costs, investment management fees or taxes (although, as noted above, the expenses of exchange-traded funds included in any Strategy are sought to be taken into account). Such simulated theoretical returns are provided for informational purposes only to indicate historical performance had the Strategy’s portfolios been available over the relevant time period. OSAM did not offer the CANVAS™ platform until April 2019.

<p><em>While they may not have been known by the same names, many modern investment factors have historical roots stretching back centuries. This series, The Factor Archives, provides historical context on the six factor themes underlying OSAM’s investment </em><a href="https://osam.com/Philosophy-and-Process" style="color: rgb(88, 182, 192);" target="_blank"><strong><em>process</em></strong></a><em style="color: rgb(88, 182, 192);">.</em><em> You can also find other posts from the Factor Archives series </em><a href="https://osam.com/Commentary" style="color: rgb(88, 182, 192);" target="_blank"><strong><em>here</em></strong></a><em>.</em></p><p><img src="https://portalvhdst3l6zspf51mvl.blob.core.windows.net/osam/blogphotos/photo_1494.jpg" width="987"/></p><blockquote class="ql-indent-1"><em style="color: rgb(0, 112, 192);">“In the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.”</em></blockquote><blockquote class="ql-indent-1">-    <strong style="color: rgb(0, 112, 192);">Benjamin Graham</strong></blockquote><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 112, 192);">INTRODUCTION</strong></p><p>The Efficient-Market Hypothesis argues that share prices reflect all available information, and thus always trade at fair value. To anyone that has spent just a few minutes reading financial history, however, this assertion is immediately questionable. If this hypothesis <em>was</em> true, there would not be examples of bubbles, panics, manias, and crashes stretching back centuries. Market inefficiencies have persisted since shares were first traded, with many borne out of investor behavior and human nature. By studying how and why such inefficiencies occur, investors can capture these market mistakes as alpha through a systematic investment approach.</p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 112, 192);">THE FACTOR THESIS</strong></p><p>After researching <a href="https://osam.com/Commentary/the-factor-archives-shareholder-yield" target="_blank">Shareholder Yield</a> in the last piece, this installment of The Factor Archives will look at Momentum, a factor rooted in human nature. For while it may be true that markets are aggregators of information, investors don’t always pay attention. As <em>The Economist</em> put it:</p><blockquote class="ql-indent-1"><em>“The efficient-market hypothesis assumes that new developments are instantly assimilated into asset prices. </em><strong><em>However, investors may be slow to adjust their opinions to fresh information. If they view a company unfavorably, they may dismiss an improvement</em></strong><em> in quarterly profits as a blip, rather than a change in trend. </em><strong><em>So, momentum may simply represent the lag between beliefs and the new reality.</em></strong><em>”</em><sup style="color: rgb(60, 70, 71);"><strong><em>1</em></strong></sup></blockquote><p>It is within this “lag between beliefs and the new reality” that factors like Momentum can generate alpha. In its simplest definition, Momentum demonstrates that over six-month and twelve-month periods, winning stocks continue to win, and losers generally continue to lose.<sup style="color: rgb(33, 37, 41);">2</sup></p><p><img src="https://portalvhdst3l6zspf51mvl.blob.core.windows.net/osam/blogphotos/photo_1499.PNG" width="621"/></p><p>For this information to be useful to an investor, however, we must understand <em>how</em> and <em>why</em> this is the case. The answer is found in behavioral finance, and human nature. In particular, the Momentum factor persists because of investor’s tendencies to chase returns, engage in herding behavior, and under or overreact to stock-specific information.</p><p>Momentum represents the moment in time when investors over-extrapolate strong earnings growth too far into the future, and ignore the possibility of mean reversion. For example, a company growing earnings 50% a year is unlikely to continue growing 50% a year forever. In the short-term, however, that company will likely perform well as investors become overly excited about its prospects. Additionally, they will likely ignore information about the slowdown in earnings once the day finally arrives, which allows the stock to trend further away from its fair value.</p><p>Put simply, stocks with unusually high growth rates get stretched well past fair value. This ‘stretching’ generates an excess return that eventually gets reversed through mean reversion. There are, however, disciplined ways to capitalize on momentum before this occurs.</p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 112, 192);">THE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE</strong></p><p><span style="color: black;">How much value can recognizing these behavioral biases add to returns, though? The chart below summarizes our research on Momentum. On the far left, Decile 1 represents the group of stocks with strong momentum. On the far right, Decile 10 shows companies with weak momentum. As you can see, there is ample opportunity for capturing alpha.</span></p><p><img src="https://portalvhdst3l6zspf51mvl.blob.core.windows.net/osam/blogphotos/photo_1496.PNG" width="964"/></p><p><span style="color: black;">To evaluate the efficacy of Momentum, we compare each group to our All Stocks Universe by Excess Return, Sharpe Ratio, and Batting Average (Base Rates). The chart clearly demonstrates that stocks with high momentum outperform the universe, offering an excess return of 4.3% annually. On a risk‐adjusted basis, these stocks also outperform, with a Sharpe Ratio 1.5x higher than the All Stocks Universe (0.58 vs. 0.35). Finally, they are also consistent, outperforming in 91% of the 648 rolling‐three-year periods. Conversely, stocks with the lowest momentum underperform by ‐8.2%, have a worse Sharpe Ratio, and only outperform the market 9% of the time in rolling-three-year periods.</span></p><p><span style="color: black;">For these reasons, OSAM not only buys stocks with strong momentum, but also screens out (avoids) those with worse momentum.</span></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 102, 204);">HISTORICAL ORIGINS: <em>CONFUSION DE CONFUSIONES</em></strong></p><p><img src="https://portalvhdst3l6zspf51mvl.blob.core.windows.net/osam/blogphotos/photo_1495.jpg" width="308"/></p><p>History is an archive of human nature, highlighting all of our behavioral biases and mistakes. Through studying history, it is readily apparent that human nature rarely changes. OSAM Chairman and Co-CIO Jim O’Shaughnessy frequently states that arbitraging human nature is the last edge. While there are countless factors and signals, many only work in shorter time frames. Conversely, factors and signals rooted in human nature provide a competitive edge that has lasted for centuries.</p><p>To demonstrate the persistence of investor’s behavioral biases, consider the first book on behavioral finance, <em>Confusion de Confusiones.</em> Written 300 years ago, the author had already recognized the biases plaguing investors:</p><blockquote class="ql-indent-1"><em>“There are as many speculators as there are people, and that there will always be buyers who will free you from anxiety… </em><strong><em>The expectation of an event creates a much deeper impression upon the exchange than the event itself</em></strong><em>. When large dividends or rich imports are expected, shares will rise in price… </em><strong><em>bulls are optimistic with joy over the state of business affairs, which is steadily favorable to them; and their attitude is so full of [unthinking] confidence that even less favorable news does not impress them and causes no anxiety.”</em></strong></blockquote><blockquote class="ql-indent-1"><strong>- Joseph de la Vega (1688)</strong><sup style="color: rgb(60, 70, 71);"><strong>3</strong></sup></blockquote><p>Today, nothing about this assessment has changed. We still ignore information contradicting our beliefs, and weigh expectations more heavily than reality in our decision-making process. Instead of just recognizing these behavioral flaws, though, the Momentum factor provides an investable strategy for arbitraging human nature. By understanding the investing public’s tendency to chase returns, over / under react to news, and engage in ‘herding behavior’, OSAM incorporates the Momentum factor by screening out of stocks with poor momentum, and favoring stocks with strong momentum.</p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 102, 204);">STRONGER TOGETHER: VALUE AND MOMENTUM</strong></p><p>In 1913, <em>The Magazine</em> of <em>Wall Street </em>correctly pointed out that <em>“prices will not proceed far, propelled by ‘momentum’ only.”</em><sup><strong><em>4</em></strong></sup> While written over a hundred years ago, this insight on the Momentum factor remains true today.</p><p><img src="https://portalvhdst3l6zspf51mvl.blob.core.windows.net/osam/blogphotos/photo_1498.PNG" width="531"/></p><p>Today, quantitative investors would update this statement to assert that ‘momentum is better incorporated into a multi-factor approach.’ One of the most effective ways to utilize Momentum is by pairing it with the Value factor.</p><p>The factors are a powerful combination for two key reasons. First, they work across different time frames. In our paper <a href="https://osam.com/Commentary/alpha-within-factors" target="_blank"><em>Alpha Within Factors</em></a>, the OSAM Research team defined Value in the following way:</p><blockquote class="ql-indent-1"><em>“The process begins when the market develops an expectation that the earnings of certain companies will decline or grow at depressed rates into the future. The market then prices those companies at a discount relative to their current earnings, turning them into ‘value stocks.’ </em><strong><em>Over the short-term, the market usually ends up being right in its expectations</em></strong><em>: value stocks usually do go on to experience declines or slowdowns in their earnings, particularly in comparison with the rest of the market. </em><strong><em>But over the long-term, they usually recover and return to normal growth</em></strong><em>. When the market prices value stocks, it tends to underestimate the likelihood and extent of their eventual recoveries. Consequently, it tends to underprice them relative to the actual stream of future earnings that they go on to generate. </em><strong><em>As the future takes shape, the market adjusts to correct this mistake, re-rating the stocks higher and delivering excess returns to those who buy at the beginning of the process</em></strong><em>.”</em><sup style="color: rgb(60, 70, 71);"><strong>5</strong></sup></blockquote><p>Momentum, meanwhile, is effective in three-month, six-month and nine-month periods. When used together, investors can reap the benefits of buying attractive companies that are trading at cheap valuations, and trending higher with strong momentum.</p><p>Since losing stocks generally continue losing across shorter time frames, the Momentum factor can also help investors avoid companies that may be trading at cheap valuations, but for good reason. These scenarios are commonly known as ‘falling knives’, or ‘value traps’.</p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 102, 204);">A HISTORY LESSON: THE RUBBER BOOM OF 1910</strong></p><p><span style="color: windowtext;">As we covered earlier, Momentum occurs when the market is confronted with exceptionally strong fundamental growth and over-extrapolates that growth into the future, failing to appreciate that mean-reversion is likely to occur. In simpler terms, you can think of Momentum as a ‘justified boom’ that eventually turns into a speculative rally as enthusiastic investors push up the price of a stock by buying at higher and higher valuations.</span></p><p><img src="https://portalvhdst3l6zspf51mvl.blob.core.windows.net/osam/blogphotos/photo_1500.jpg" width="1128"/></p><blockquote class="ql-indent-1"><em> “</em><strong><em>The rubber boom stands out as unique from other kindred movements, the rise being to a large extent justified</em></strong><em> as regards the shares in the producing companies and in certain others which were moderately capitalized and had good dividend prospects.”</em><sup style="color: rgb(60, 70, 71);"><strong><em>6</em></strong></sup></blockquote><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 102, 204);">A Justified Boom With Solid Foundations</strong></p><p><span style="color: windowtext;">The ‘Rubber Boom’ in early 20</span><sup style="color: windowtext;">th</sup><span style="color: windowtext;"> century London offers a perfect case study of how strong stock returns originally justified by growing earnings can quickly morph into a speculative ‘boom’. Investors chased returns, herded into rubber companies' shares, and ignored information that indicated a reversal was likely.</span></p><p><span style="color: windowtext;">First, it is important to understand what drove the excitement for rubber shares. As it turns out, the reasoning was simple. Coming off the back of a ‘bicycle mania’ at the end of the 19</span><sup style="color: windowtext;">th</sup><span style="color: windowtext;"> century, another new technological innovation requiring tires had just started rolling off the assembly lines in America: the automobile. Explaining his investment thesis, one investment manager exclaimed:</span></p><blockquote class="ql-indent-1"><em>“If you take two of the industries which are practically </em><strong><em>the largest users of rubber, like electricity and motor traction</em></strong><em>, </em><strong><em>I do not think that anyone can come to any other conclusion than that both these industries, large as they may be to-day, as yet are only in their infancy</em></strong><em>.”</em><sup style="color: rgb(60, 70, 71);"><strong><em>7</em></strong></sup></blockquote><p><span style="color: windowtext;">These two new forms of transportation, particularly the automobile, led to a burgeoning demand for tires, and consequently, rubber. </span></p><blockquote class="ql-indent-1"><strong><em>“The Rubber Boom undoubtedly has solid foundation. New uses are constantly being found for rubber, and there is an increasing demand for the articles in which it is used to present….</em></strong><em> </em><strong><em>There are ample materials here for a legitimate boom</em></strong><em>, and there can be little doubt that there are good prospects of a prosperous future for those rubber companies which have chosen their ground well, and whose flotation has been carried with wisdom and moderation.”</em><sup style="color: rgb(60, 70, 71);"><strong><em>8</em></strong></sup></blockquote><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 102, 204);">A Speculative Herd Moves In</strong></p><p><span style="color: windowtext;">While rubber prices soared higher, so did shares of rubber companies and plantations reaping increasingly large profits. Observing a combination of steadily climbing share prices and substantial dividends, it did not take long for the investment public to plow their capital into shares of rubber companies at exactly the wrong time, when shares were expensive. A journalist at the time lamented:</span></p><blockquote class="ql-indent-1"><em>“</em><strong><em>The madness of speculation</em></strong><em>, however, decrees that </em><strong><em>at the height of its fever people shall rush in to buy whatever may be offered</em></strong><em>, whereas, </em><strong><em>on a return to sanity by the market as a whole, the sounder opportunities then presented for money-making are pushed aside with impatience</em></strong><em>, or contemplated with polite indifference."</em><sup style="color: rgb(60, 70, 71);"><strong><em>9</em></strong></sup></blockquote><p><span style="color: windowtext;">Suddenly, what had previously been a ‘justified’ boom in profitable rubber companies turned into a speculative fever fueled by retail investors. Stories quickly spread around London of a city merchant who quit his job to day trade rubber shares full-time, and a group of hotel guests that started a trading operation out of their room in a Swiss ski resort.</span><sup style="color: windowtext;">10</sup><span style="color: windowtext;"> </span><em style="color: windowtext;">The Economist</em><span style="color: windowtext;"> wrote:</span></p><blockquote class="ql-indent-1"><em>“There are also many signs that </em><strong><em>the point has now been reached at which prudent optimism ceases and is replaced by emotional enthusiasm</em></strong><em>. Prospectuses pour out, and subscriptions pour in. </em><strong><em>The speculative public wants rubber shares-it does not care which</em></strong><em>.”</em><sup style="color: rgb(60, 70, 71);"><strong><em>11</em></strong></sup></blockquote><p>Taken from the same publication, a century apart, that <em>“point”</em> where <em>“prudent optimism ceases, and is replaced by emotional enthusiasm”</em> is very similar to the description of momentum included at the start of this article: <em>“</em><em style="color: black;">momentum may simply represent the lag between beliefs and the new reality.”</em></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 102, 204);">Rational Investors</strong></p><p><span style="color: windowtext;">Not all participants in the rubber boom were gambling speculators, however. Firms like the ‘Rubber Plantation Investment Trust’</span><em style="color: windowtext;"> </em><span style="color: windowtext;">remained disciplined both before the boom broke out, and during. In fact, the trust practiced early forms of the principles guiding OSAM’s investment philosophy today. Through careful due diligence, the trust identified rubber companies trading at cheap valuations, demonstrating good governance, and recording strong earnings.</span></p><p><span style="color: windowtext;">From inception, the trust was clear in its intent to find quality businesses at reasonable or cheap prices:</span></p><blockquote class="ql-indent-1"><em>“You, ladies and gentlemen, are in the fortunate position of having a good stock of shares in first-class rubber-producing companies, </em><strong><em>bought at most moderate prices and enhancing in value</em></strong><em> day by day, and I have not the slightest doubt that our mutual undertaking will have a most prosperous future.”</em><sup style="color: rgb(60, 70, 71);"><strong><em>12</em></strong></sup></blockquote><p><span style="color: windowtext;">By building their portfolio around cheap stocks, they benefited from the momentum in rubber stocks as retail investors recognized the value of rubber plantations, and eventually herded into the sector, pushing share prices higher. In their annual shareholder meeting, one of the managers commented:</span></p><blockquote class="ql-indent-1"><em>“What a change do we find in the conditions of the rubber share market since I had the pleasure of addressing you in June last</em><strong><em>… </em></strong><strong style="color: rgb(30, 34, 35);"><em>Now everybody has a craving for rubber shares</em></strong><strong><em>.</em></strong><em> One of the first paragraphs in the summary of every financial paper is devoted to the rubber market and </em><strong style="color: rgb(30, 34, 35);"><em>a breakfast table unadorned by at least one rubber prospectus would look very unappetizing…</em></strong></blockquote><blockquote class="ql-indent-1"><strong style="color: rgb(30, 34, 35);"><em>Your board have not omitted to take advantage of this state of things</em></strong><em>, and they have, of course, had many opportunities of</em><strong><em> </em></strong><strong style="color: rgb(30, 34, 35);"><em>furthering your interests by acquiring blocks of shares in the best rubber companies… The public subscribed all these securities with great avidity, and they have attained to substantial premia.</em></strong><em>”</em><sup style="color: rgb(60, 70, 71);"><strong><em>13</em></strong></sup></blockquote><p><span style="color: windowtext;">In addition to focusing on Value, </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Momentum can similarly improve returns when paired with other quality factor themes like Financial Strength, Earnings Growth, and Earnings Quality.

Anything that kept profits from piling high in a company’s coffers could help deter managers from stealing, squandering or abusing their power.”</em></blockquote><blockquote><span style="color: rgb(102, 163, 224);">     </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 71, 178);">  - Jason Zweig, (The Wall Street Journal)</span><sup style="color: rgb(0, 71, 178);">1</sup></blockquote><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 112, 192);">THE FACTOR THESIS</strong></p><p>In our view, management teams serve their shareholders in two capacities: (1) Generate profits and (2) Efficiently allocate those profits for shareholders’ long‐term benefit. In an analysis of corporate allocation over several decades, we find that the most rewarding way to allocate capital is by returning it to shareholders.</p><p>Recognizing both the positives and negatives of each method, our approach aims to capture the benefits of both dividends <strong><em>and</em></strong> buybacks. <strong>The</strong> <strong>Shareholder Yield factor is the sum of a stock’s dividend yield and the percentage of net share buybacks over the previous twelve months</strong>.</p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 112, 192);">THE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE</strong></p><p>In fact, one of the most effective U.S. stock selection strategies in recent decades has been buying stocks in the midst of repurchasing significant quantities of their own shares.</p><p><img src="https://portalvhdst3l6zspf51mvl.blob.core.windows.net/osam/blogphotos/photo_1492.PNG" width="736"/></p><p>The chart below summarizes our research on Shareholder Yield. Decile 1 represents the group of stocks rewarding shareholders with high levels of dividends and buybacks; decile 10 shows companies generally not paying dividends and issuing shares. The chart demonstrates that the stocks with high Shareholder Yield outperform the All Stocks Universe by 3.5% annually.</p><p><img src="https://portalvhdst3l6zspf51mvl.blob.core.windows.net/osam/blogphotos/photo_1491.PNG" width="719"/></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 112, 192);">HISTORICAL ORIGINS: SHAREHOLDER YIELD IN THE WORLD’S FIRST MUTUAL FUND</strong></p><p><img src="https://portalvhdst3l6zspf51mvl.blob.core.windows.net/osam/blogphotos/photo_1489.jpeg" width="687"/></p><p>An early example of Shareholder Yield is found in the world’s first mutual fund, <em>Eendragt Maakt Magt </em>(Unity Creates Strength). Founded in 1774 by a Dutch broker named Abraham van Ketwich, the diversified strategy was equally weighted across ten categories of bonds and loans. Similar to modern ETFs, the fund offered small investors cheap access to a portfolio capturing the broader market.</p><p>While the fund’s prospectus promised an annual dividend of 4%, it also outlined an innovative buyback program representing the first example of Shareholder Yield.<sup>2</sup> Financial historian K. Geert Rouwenhorst, an expert on these early mutual funds, notes:</p><blockquote class="ql-indent-1"><em style="color: rgb(91, 102, 112);">“Not all investment income from the underlying portfolio would be passed on to the fund investors as dividends; rather, </em><strong style="color: rgb(91, 102, 112);"><em>a portion was to be used to retire </em>[repurchase]<em> shares by lot at a premium over the par value of the shares and also to increase dividends to some of the outstanding shares.”</em></strong><sup style="color: rgb(91, 102, 112);"><strong><em>3</em></strong></sup></blockquote><p>This is similar to the modern benefits of corporate buybacks, which increase Earnings Per Share (EPS) by reducing the number of outstanding shares via repurchases.</p><p><u style="color: rgb(0, 112, 192);">High Conviction Buybacks</u></p><p>OSAM’s approach to Shareholder Yield focuses on identifying ‘High Conviction Buyback’ companies, which repurchase over roughly 5% of their outstanding shares, and at cheap valuations.</p><p>In the case of <em>Eendragt Maakt Magt, </em>the managers certainly showed conviction in repurchasing their shares at a steep discount. In 1811, the fund repurchased shares on the open market at a <strong><em>75% discount</em></strong>, or 125 Guilders a share. When the fund eventually closed, these shares were each worth 561 Guilders. Van Ketwich was clearly a true value investor.<sup>4</sup></p><p>In fact, van Ketwich’s funds not only contained a Shareholder Yield component, but his second fund, <em>Concordia Res Parvae Crescunt</em>, is credited as the world’s first value fund. The prospectus stated that the strategy favored:</p><blockquote class="ql-indent-1"><em style="color: rgb(91, 102, 112);">“Solid securities and those that based on decline in their price would merit speculation and </em><strong style="color: rgb(91, 102, 112);"><em>could be purchased below their intrinsic values… of which one has every reason to expect an important benefit</em></strong><em style="color: rgb(91, 102, 112);">”</em><sup style="color: rgb(91, 102, 112);"><em>5</em></sup></blockquote><p>Even in 1779, Shareholder Yield and Value were a powerful combination. A truth still evident today:</p><p><img src="https://portalvhdst3l6zspf51mvl.blob.core.windows.net/osam/blogphotos/photo_1493.PNG" width="734"/></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 112, 192);">A HISTORY LESSON: THE DUTCH EAST INDIA COMPANY &amp; 18TH CENTURY BUYBACKS</strong></p><p><img src="https://portalvhdst3l6zspf51mvl.blob.core.windows.net/osam/blogphotos/photo_1485.png" width="601"/></p><p>Shareholder Yield is a powerful tool for identifying good management teams, since it represents efficient capital allocation, and returning cash to shareholders. This section dives into early examples of Shareholder Yield’s underlying components: Dividends and Buybacks.</p><p><u style="color: rgb(0, 112, 192);">Dividends</u></p><p>The modern stock market began in 1602, when shares of the Dutch East India Company (VOC) traded on the Amsterdam Exchange. However, despite an incredible business monopoly on trade, and incessant demands from shareholders, the VOC did not pay a dividend until 1610. Even still, this first dividend was paid in spices! Shareholders received “<em>mace at a value of 75% of the nominal capital”</em>. It wasn’t until 1612 that the company finally paid a cash dividend.<sup>6</sup></p><p>The VOC’s early years were marred by constant criticism and complaints from shareholders over management’s poor allocation of capital, and dividend policy.</p><p>Beginning in 1609, the infamous first short-seller, Isaac Le Maire, published a pamphlet levying three primary criticisms against management:<sup>7</sup></p><ol><li>The company’s rising debt levels reduced shareholders profits to the point that dividends could not be paid.</li><li>The board was not open to receiving advice, or hearing arguments and complaints from investors.</li><li>Directors were <em>“enriching themselves to the detriment of shareholders while trying to get the obligation to publish accounts </em>[financial statements] <em>waived.”</em></li></ol><p>While he lost many other battles with the VOC, the company’s decision to issue dividends (even in spices!) the following year yielded a definitive victory for Le Maire. Despite this temporarily satisfying shareholders, however, the pamphlets and petitions persisted. In 1622, a group of disgruntled shareholders criticized management for wasting capital:</p><blockquote class="ql-indent-1"><em style="color: rgb(91, 102, 112);">“That route, however, does not lead through the Strait of Magellan, </em><strong style="color: rgb(91, 102, 112);"><em>where they wasted the capital of the company</em></strong><em style="color: rgb(91, 102, 112);">… Each of the directors sells something </em><span style="color: rgb(91, 102, 112);">[to the company] </span><em style="color: rgb(91, 102, 112);">in order to maximize his profits.... But why, my dearest Gentlemen, doesn’t the company organize a public auction, why doesn’t it purchase the goods from anybody who is willing to accept the lowest price? </em><strong style="color: rgb(91, 102, 112);"><em>This may save one third of the construction costs of the ships.</em></strong><em style="color: rgb(91, 102, 112);">” </em></blockquote><blockquote class="ql-indent-1"><strong style="color: rgb(91, 102, 112);">– Dissenting Shareholders (1622)</strong><sup style="color: rgb(91, 102, 112);"><strong>8</strong></sup></blockquote><p>As a result, the company’s new charter in 1623 ceded increased oversight, regular audits, and a more frequent dividend program that kept investors happy. Since the modern stock market’s inception, there has been a close relationship between effective capital allocation, and dividend policy.<sup>9</sup></p><p><u style="color: rgb(0, 112, 192);">Buybacks</u></p><p>In addition to the <em>Eendragt Maakt Magt</em> example earlier, Jason Zweig’s recent <em>Wall Street Journal</em> article proved that buyback programs have existed in the United States since at <em>least </em>1798.<sup>10</sup> In that year, the Pennsylvania state legislature approved a charter for the Germantown &amp; Reading Turnpike Road Company, provided it committed to repurchasing shares using any excess profits left after paying its 9% dividend.<sup>11</sup></p><p><img src="https://portalvhdst3l6zspf51mvl.blob.core.windows.net/osam/blogphotos/photo_1490.png" width="626"/></p><p>Like the early dividends in 17<sup>th </sup>century Amsterdam, this 18<sup>th</sup> century buyback program in Pennsylvania aimed to prevent management from wasting shareholders’ capital. Zweig’s article states:</p><blockquote class="ql-indent-1"><strong style="color: rgb(91, 102, 112);"><em>“Mandatory stock buybacks—like the 6% to 10% dividends that were customary at the time—appear to have been intended to keep management from pocketing or wasting the public’s wealth.</em></strong><em style="color: rgb(91, 102, 112);"> Anything that kept profits from piling high in a company’s coffers could help deter managers from stealing, squandering or abusing their power.”</em><sup style="color: rgb(91, 102, 112);"><em>12</em></sup></blockquote><p>Even our nation’s founding fathers acknowledged management’s tendency to waste capital. Hugh Williamson, who signed the U.S. Constitution, wrote:</p><blockquote class="ql-indent-1"><em style="color: rgb(91, 102, 112);">“Certainly it is to be desired that Companies were formed and that Copper Mines were diligently wrought, but if Government ever becomes Partners, they will infallibly be the milch cow… </em><strong style="color: rgb(91, 102, 112);"><em>I have seen too many of these large companies foolishly and extravagantly managed, where they have proved insolvent. The Paterson manufacturing company- sundry canal companies have vanished into smoke.</em></strong><em style="color: rgb(91, 102, 112);">”</em><sup style="color: rgb(91, 102, 112);"><em>13</em></sup></blockquote><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 112, 192);">﻿THE WAY-WAY BACKTEST: ANNUAL DIVIDEND YIELDS OF THE VOC</strong><sup style="color: rgb(0, 112, 192);"><strong>14</strong></sup></p><p><img src="https://portalvhdst3l6zspf51mvl.blob.core.windows.net/osam/blogphotos/photo_1486.PNG" width="850"/></p><p><strong style="color: rgb(0, 112, 192);">MODERN PERSPECTIVES: WHAT NOW?</strong></p><p>As the nascent stock market evolved in 17<sup>th</sup> century Holland, investors recognized the importance of efficient capital allocation, and shareholder distributions. Since buybacks did not yet exist, there were two ways management could do this: cash dividends, and ‘spice dividends’. Roughly two hundred years later, the Pennsylvania Legislature implemented a mandatory buyback program for local turnpike companies.</p><p>Today, the importance of Shareholder Yield has only increased. Companies have trillions of dollars sitting in cash and easy access to debt capital, increasing the odds of poor capital allocation by management. A prudent move for some firms could be to distribute cash back to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks.</p><p>The current outlook for Shareholder Yield as an investment factor is increasingly attractive. The bar to qualify for the highest decile of Shareholder Yield has been getting higher as more companies announce buyback programs, and the stocks in this top decile have gradually become cheaper. As outlined earlier, the combination of Shareholder Yield and Value is powerful, and these stocks are consequently poised to deliver strong performance when value comes back into favor.</p><p>By using Shareholder Yield in our investment process, OSAM can identify ‘High Conviction Buyback’ stocks that have historically delivered strong outperformance.</p><p><img src="https://portalvhdst3l6zspf51mvl.blob.core.windows.net/osam/blogphotos/photo_1488.PNG" width="904"/></p><h3>Appendix</h3><p><sup>1</sup> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-fireworks-over-share-buybacks-are-duds-11562338801?mod=article_inline" target="_blank">Jason Zweig, ‘The Fireworks Over Share Buybacks Are Duds’, <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> (July 5, 2019)</a></p><p><sup>2</sup> <a href="https://ssrn.com/abstract=636146" target="_blank">K.

In an era when the basic factors could become commodities, the hunt for unique signals and factors represents an ever-expanding new frontier for quantitative investors.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(60, 70, 71);">This article is the first installment of </span><strong style="color: rgb(60, 70, 71);"><em>The Factor Archives</em></strong><span style="color: rgb(60, 70, 71);">, an OSAM series looking at the past, present, and future of factor investing across the six factor themes underlying our process.

When the telescope hit markets in 1608, it allowed traders to monitor ships entering Dutch ports carrying commodities before anyone else. While this was a clear informational advantage, how the investors interpreted and utilized this information provided an even stronger </span><em style="color: rgb(60, 70, 71);">analytical </em><span style="color: rgb(60, 70, 71);">edge.</span><sup style="color: rgb(60, 70, 71);">2</sup><img src="https://portalvhdst3l6zspf51mvl.blob.core.windows.net/osam/blogphotos/photo_1475.png"/></p><p><span style="color: rgb(60, 70, 71);">Their systematic approach was simplistic by modern standards, but advanced for the time. Using the telescope, investors could reasonably conclude that ships sitting lower in the water signaled the vessel was being weighed down by a large supply of commodities, which would depreciate prices when sold on the market.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(60, 70, 71);">Identifying this information in advance was an advantage, as it allowed investors to place trades long before others received word of the new shipment.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(60, 70, 71);">The Dutch investors were utilizing a rudimentary systematic-factor model. They found a useful signal indicative of future commodity returns (price) and leveraged technology (the telescope) to execute their edge.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(60, 70, 71);">Despite the analytical and informational edge, the pricing signal’s short “half-life” was problematic. The information was only useful for a short timeframe, an issue that still plagues modern markets, with some High-Frequency Trading firms striving for an ‘edge’ lasting mere milliseconds. As signals with short half-lives get commoditized over time, we prefer relentlessly researching and testing signals with much longer half-lives. In our view, the key to developing a sustainable advantage is basing the ‘building blocks’ of an investment process on factors with a proven record of generating long-term outperformance.</span></p><h3><span style="color: rgb(0, 112, 192);">SIGNAL DECAYS &amp; EFFICACY</span></h3><p><span style="color: rgb(60, 70, 71);">On the Dojima Rice Exchange in 18th century Japan, an investor named Yomiji Sumiya was forced to learn that relying on a single investment signal or factor is a risky venture.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(60, 70, 71);">Yomiji’s investment career began after Japanese officials loosened regulations on trading rice futures. Like the Dutch traders, Yomiji utilized the telescope to create a systematic process based upon his informational advantage. His intricate system was outlined in this original source from 1706:</span></p><blockquote class="ql-indent-1"><em style="color: rgb(60, 70, 71);">“A minute after the rice exchange started the business of the day in Osaka, the [second] messenger wearing red hat and red gloves ran like a flying bird and arrived at Kuragari Pass...

His role was to inform Yomiji of the increases and decreases of rice prices. Yomiji saw the person’s </em><strong style="color: rgb(60, 70, 71);"><em>signals</em></strong><span style="color: rgb(60, 70, 71);"> </span><em style="color: rgb(60, 70, 71);">from the second floor of the wholesale store using a </em><strong style="color: rgb(60, 70, 71);"><em>telescope</em></strong><span style="color: rgb(60, 70, 71);"> </span><em style="color: rgb(60, 70, 71);">which had a range of 10 miles, and bought or sold rice taking these price changes into consideration. After that, Yomiji [publicly] dispatched the express messenger to Osaka to obtain the rice prices there. As Yomiji knew the rice prices earlier than anyone when the information was delivered to Kuragari Pass, </em><strong style="color: rgb(60, 70, 71);"><em>there was not a single day that Yomiji did not make money</em>." </strong><sup style="color: rgb(60, 70, 71);">3 </sup></blockquote><p><span style="color: rgb(60, 70, 71);"><img src="https://portalvhdst3l6zspf51mvl.blob.core.windows.net/osam/blogphotos/photo_1476.png" width="549"/></span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(60, 70, 71);">Mystified by his consistently high returns, other merchants nicknamed him “Forecasting Yomiji”. Unfortunately for Yomiji, his streak would soon come to an end.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(60, 70, 71);">One day, as his messenger was running back from the rice exchange to signal that morning’s prices, he bumped into an old friend. The two of them decided to catch up over drinks at the local bar and proceeded to knock back 7–8 glasses of sake each.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(60, 70, 71);">Eventually, the messenger realized that he was four hours late to signal the rice data to Yomiji and sprinted out of the bar in a panic. When he finally arrived:</span></p><blockquote class="ql-indent-1"><em style="color: rgb(60, 70, 71);">“The 7–8 glasses of sake greatly affected his memory, and he did not recall whether he should raise his left hand or right hand...

For even the most robust factors and signals will endure bouts of underperformance, like the Value factor in recent years.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(60, 70, 71);">Today, the importance of utilizing multiple signals is applicable to both factors in general, but also the metrics on which they are evaluated. Value investing, for example, is a proven strategy for generating strong long-term investment results. There have been numerous metrics for measuring the Value factor, and some have lost their efficacy over time. Consider Book Value, the original metric for measuring a company’s “cheapness”. In the last two decades, accounting rules and structural changes to the market have </span><a href="https://osam.com/Commentary/negative-equity-veiled-value-and-the-erosion-of-price-to-book" style="color: rgb(88, 182, 192);" target="_blank">reduced the efficacy of book value</a><span style="color: rgb(60, 70, 71);">, and associated metrics like Price-to-Book (P/B). </span><sup style="color: rgb(60, 70, 71);">5</sup></p><p><span style="color: rgb(60, 70, 71);">For instance, companies that are considered expensive by book value standards can sometimes be cheap when measured by other metrics like earnings, sales, or cash flow. This implies that book value in its raw form has become relatively outdated, a point made by Warren Buffet, cult-hero of value investing:</span></p><blockquote class="ql-indent-1"><em style="color: rgb(60, 70, 71);">“For almost three decades, the initial paragraph [of the annual letter] featured the percentage change in Berkshire’s per-share book value. </em><strong style="color: rgb(60, 70, 71);"><em>It’s now time to abandon that practice</em></strong><span style="color: rgb(60, 70, 71);">.</span></blockquote><blockquote class="ql-indent-1"><strong style="color: rgb(60, 70, 71);"><em>The fact is that the annual change in Berkshire’s book value — which makes its farewell appearance on page 2 — is a metric that has lost the relevance it once had...</em></strong><span style="color: rgb(60, 70, 71);"> </span><em style="color: rgb(60, 70, 71);">First, Berkshire has gradually morphed from a company whose assets are concentrated in marketable stocks into one whose major value resides in operating businesses...

Third, it is likely that — over time — Berkshire will be a significant repurchaser of its shares... </em><strong style="color: rgb(60, 70, 71);"><em>That combination causes the book-value scorecard to become increasingly out of touch with economic reality.”</em></strong><em style="color: rgb(60, 70, 71);"> </em><sup style="color: rgb(60, 70, 71);"><em>6</em></sup></blockquote><p><span style="color: rgb(60, 70, 71);">This argument is supported by the data below, which demonstrates that the efficacy of P/B has clearly waned over time.</span><sup style="color: rgb(60, 70, 71);">7 </sup><span style="color: rgb(60, 70, 71);">In addition, the data proves that incorporating multiple factors- or a ‘composite’ of value metrics- outperforms the average value metric independently.

If actual accounts had been managed throughout the period, ongoing research might have resulted in changes to the strategy which might have altered returns. The performance of any account or investment strategy managed by OSAM will differ from the hypothetical backtested performance results for each factor shown herein for a number of reasons, including without limitation the following:</h6><h6><span style="color: rgb(60, 70, 71);">Although OSAM may consider from time to time one or more of the factors noted herein in managing any account, it may not consider all or any of such factors. OSAM may (and will) from time to time consider factors in addition to those noted herein in managing any account.</span></h6><h6><span style="color: rgb(60, 70, 71);">OSAM may rebalance an account more frequently or less frequently than annually and at times other than presented herein.</span></h6><h6><span style="color: rgb(60, 70, 71);">OSAM may from time to time manage an account by using non-quantitative, subjective investment management methodologies in conjunction with the</span></h6><h6><span style="color: rgb(60, 70, 71);">application of factors.</span></h6><h6><span style="color: rgb(60, 70, 71);">The hypothetical backtested performance results assume full investment, whereas an account managed by OSAM may have a positive cash position upon rebalance. Had the hypothetical backtested performance results included a positive cash position, the results would have been different and generally would have been lower.</span></h6><h6><span style="color: rgb(60, 70, 71);">The hypothetical backtested performance results for each factor do not reflect any transaction costs of buying and selling securities, investment management fees (including without limitation management fees and performance fees), custody and other costs, or taxes – all of which would be incurred by an investor in any account managed by OSAM. If such costs and fees were reflected, the hypothetical backtested performance results would be lower.</span><span style="color: rgb(44, 53, 53);">Therefore, it should be noted that on the previous pages of this presentation, any back-tested results may be reflected gross of fees. Had OSAM managed the back-tested Portfolio during the corresponding time period, the deduction of an OSAM fee would have decreased the reflected results. For example, the deduction of a 1.00% fee over a 10-year period would have reduced a 10% gross of fees gain to an 8.9% net of fees gain.</span></h6><h6><span style="color: rgb(60, 70, 71);">The hypothetical performance does not reflect the reinvestment of dividends and distributions therefrom, interest, capital gains and withholding taxes.</span></h6><h6><span style="color: rgb(60, 70, 71);">Accounts managed by OSAM are subject to additions and redemptions of assets under management, which may positively or negatively affect performance depending generally upon the timing of such events in relation to the market’s direction. Simulated returns may be dependent on the market and economic conditions that existed during the period. Future market or economic conditions can adversely affect the returns.</span></h6><p><br/></p>
