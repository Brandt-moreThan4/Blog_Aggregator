<p>Whether or not the proponents of either asset want to admit it, Gold and Bitcoin share many commonalities. In particular, they are similar in the fact that they incite very polarizing views on their value and utility. You will be hard pressed to find many investors that have no view on Gold or Bitcoin. It is much more likely that you will receive arguments for why either asset is “useless” and “has no value”, or “provides the best hedge for X/Y/Z” and acts as a superior “store of value”. The point is, people hold very strong opinions on Gold and Bitcoin.</p>

<p>As long as there have been financial markets, there have been concerns that the government will bring ruin to the financial system and nation’s currency. For example, the image below is basically a 19th century of the “money printer go brrr” meme:</p>
<div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_7797" style="width: 635px"><img alt="" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-7797" class="wp-image-7797" height="522" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px" src="https://investoramnesia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Running-the-Machine.png" srcset="https://investoramnesia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Running-the-Machine.png 889w, https://investoramnesia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Running-the-Machine-300x251.png 300w, https://investoramnesia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Running-the-Machine-768x642.png 768w" width="625"/><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-7797">“Money Printer Go Brrrr” Meme (19th Century Edition)</p></div>
<p>For those worried that the Fed’s decisions will lead to hyperinflation, gold and Bitcoin both claim to act as the perfect hedge for such problematic policies.</p>
<p>Regarding gold, the WSJ <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-gold-prices-are-hitting-all-time-highs-11596533550?mod=searchresults&amp;page=2&amp;pos=20" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">wrote</a>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>“<strong>The Federal Reserve’s March decision to slash interest rates to just above zero and buy hundreds of billions of dollars of bonds has pulled down yields in fixed-income markets, prompting investors to buy gold instead.</strong> Some money managers expect inflation to pick up once the economic crunch is over, which would act as a further drag on real yields if nominal rates don’t rise.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Investors are also buying gold because they think it will hold its value if stocks take another tumble. <strong>Enthusiasts take this argument a step further, contending that gold is the ultimate insurance policy against a scenario in which the U.S. government defaults or kindles inflation to alleviate the burden of debt.</strong>“</em></p>
<p>For Bitcoin, an article from Coin Desk stated:</p>
<div class="article-pharagraph" id="node-23">
<p class="text" style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>“As traditional finance zigs down the QE route, bitcoin is zagging in the opposite direction… In two months, the supply of new bitcoin will be reduced by 50 percent – an occurrence scheduled for roughly every four years known as the ‘halving.’ </em></p>
</div>
<div class="article-pharagraph" id="node-25" style="padding-left: 40px;">
<p class="text"><em>‘<strong>As the U.S. government prints another trillion-plus dollars, this will have long-term ramifications on inflation and dilution of money. On the other hand, we will still have 21 million [bitcoins] available, ever</strong>,’ said Alex Blum, COO of Hong Kong-based fintech firm Two Prime.”</em></p>
</div>
<p>The argument goes that while inflationary government and central bank policies will weaken the dollar, gold and Bitcoin can protect investor’s wealth because of their finite supply.</p>
<p><strong>Bitcoin is Gold for Millennials</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>One increasingly popular narrative is that Bitcoin is ‘Gold’ for Millennials, and this week was the perfect microcosm of that view.</p></blockquote>
<p>First, for those that don’t know who Dave Portnoy is, he’s the CEO of Barstool Sports. More importantly, however, he’s the newly promoted <strong><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/15/business/dealbook/dave-portnoy-markets.html">‘Captain of the Day Traders’</a></strong>. During COVID-19 Portnoy has been very publicly day trading by live-streaming twice a day at the opening / closing bells. After buying airline stocks at the same time that Buffett was making headlines for selling them, Portnoy famously declared that Buffett was washed up when airline stocks rallied from their lows and Portnoy made a healthy profit:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-dnt="true" data-width="550">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">I’m sure Warren Buffett is a great guy but when it comes to stocks he’s washed up. I’m the captain now. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DDTG?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#DDTG</a> <a href="https://t.co/WqMR89c7kt">pic.twitter.com/WqMR89c7kt</a></p>
<p>— Dave Portnoy (@stoolpresidente) <a href="https://twitter.com/stoolpresidente/status/1270350291653791747?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 9, 2020</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async="" charset="utf-8" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"></script></p>
<p>David Portnoy is the ultimate millennial day trader. Within the narrative of “Bitcoin is for Millennials and Gold is for Boomers”, it’s fairly clear which camps Portnoy and Buffett would fall into were they to purchase one of these two assets.</p>
<p>Well, after this week we no longer have to speculate (pun intended) on which asset Portnoy and Buffett would invest in after Buffett made headlines for purchasing $565 million worth of shares in Barrick Gold Corporation.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-7793" height="139" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 747px) 100vw, 747px" src="https://investoramnesia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/buffett.png" srcset="https://investoramnesia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/buffett.png 1363w, https://investoramnesia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/buffett-300x56.png 300w, https://investoramnesia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/buffett-1024x191.png 1024w, https://investoramnesia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/buffett-768x143.png 768w" width="747"/></p>
<p>For gold bugs, this was a big deal because of how openly negative Buffett had been on gold in the past:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>“(<b>Gold</b>) gets dug out of the ground in Africa, or someplace. Then we melt it down, dig another hole, bury it again and pay people to stand around guarding it. <strong>It has no utility. Anyone watching from Mars would be scratching their head.</strong>”</em></p></blockquote>
<p>On the other end of the spectrum, Dave Portnoy posted a 10-minute video on Twitter with the Winklevoss twins about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies that ended with Portnoy making a sizable investment in Bitcoin. There are obviously thousands of reasons why David Portnoy and Warren Buffett are not an apples-to-apples comparison, but their investment decisions this week were the perfect microcosm of the narrative that the younger generation is to Bitcoin what Gold is to the older investors.</p>
<p>The future is obviously uncertain, but it will be interesting to see whether the performance of Bitcoin during this year’s bear market will leave a lasting impression on younger investors and influence their view of Bitcoin as a hedging asset like the older generation views gold.</p>

<p>Debates surrounding the gold standard and gold as an asset have always had a political aspect, as many of the stated reasons for owning the precious metal are related to hedging the negative repercussions of fiscal and monetary policy (inflation, weakening currency, etc.). Within the United States, an early example of this relationship between gold and politics is found in the late 19th century after the Panic of 1893 resulted in a national referendum on the gold standard via the 1896 Presidential Election.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>“<strong>In the late 1800s, a surge in silver production made a shift toward a monetary standard based on gold and silver rather than gold alone increasingly attractive to debtors seeking relief through higher prices.</strong> The U.S. government made a tentative step in this direction with the Sherman Silver Purchase Act, an 1890 law requiring the Treasury to significantly increase its purchases of silver. <strong>Concern about the United States abandoning the gold standard, however, drove up the demand for gold, which drained the Treasury’s holdings and created strains on the financial system’s liquidity.</strong> <strong>News in April 1893 that the government was running low on gold was followed by the Panic in May and a severe depression </strong>involving widespread commercial and bank failures.”</em></p>
<p>The Panic of 1893 was heavily influenced by issues with the gold standard, as a <a href="https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/banking_panics_of_the_gilded_age" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Federal Reserve article</a> on banking panics during the Gilded Age describes:</p>
<div class="row embedded-image-component left-aligned">
<div class="large-15 component">
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>“<strong>The Panic of 1893 was one of the most severe financial crises in the history of the United States.</strong> The crisis started with banks in the interior of the country. <strong>Instability arose for two key reasons. First, gold reserves maintained by the US Treasury fell to about $100 million from $190 million in 1890. </strong>At the time, the United States was on the gold standard, which meant that notes issued by the Treasury could be redeemed for a fixed amount of gold.<strong> The falling gold reserves raised concerns at home and abroad that the United States might be forced to suspend the convertibility of notes, which may have prompted depositors to withdraw bank notes and convert their wealth into gold. The second source of this instability was that economic activity slowed prior to the panic. The recession raised rates of defaults on loans, which weakened banks’ balance sheets. </strong>Fearing for the safety of their deposits, men and women began to withdraw funds from banks. Fear spread and withdrawals accelerated, leading to widespread runs on banks.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em><strong>In June, bank runs swept through midwestern and western cities such as Chicago and Los Angeles. More than one-hundred banks suspended operations. From mid-July to mid-August, the panic intensified, with 340 banks suspending operations. As these banks came under pressure, they withdrew funds that they kept on deposit in banks in New York City. Those banks soon felt strained. To satisfy withdrawal requests, money center banks began selling assets. During the fire sale, asset prices plummeted, which threatened the solvency of the entire banking system. In early August, New York banks sought to save themselves by slowing the outflow of currency to the rest of the country. The result was that in the interior local banks were unable to meet currency demand, and many failed.</strong> Commerce and industry contracted. In many places, individuals, firms, and financial institutions began to use temporary expediencies, such as scrip or clearing-house certificates, to make payments when the banking system failed to function effectively.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>In the fall, the banking panic ended. Gold inflows from Europe lowered interest rates. Banks resumed operations. Cash and credit resumed lubricating the wheels of commerce and industry. Nevertheless, the economy remained in recession until the following summer. According to estimates by Andrew Jalil and Charles Hoffman, <strong>industrial production fell by 15.3 percent between 1892 and 1894, and unemployment rose to between 17 and 19 percent. After a brief pause, the economy slumped into recession again in late 1895 and did not fully recover until mid-1897.</strong>“</em></p>

<div></div>
<div style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>“<strong>The United States was technically on a bimetallic monetary standard until 1900, but the Coinage Act of 1873 made no provision for minting silver coins. As a result, only gold coins circulated widely. This condition spawned a “free-silver” political movement to bring silver coins back into circulation.</strong> <strong>One goal of the movement was to greatly expand the money supply, thus helping farmers obtain higher prices for their produce while servicing their debts with inflated dollars.</strong> In fairness to the farmers, <strong>the free-silver movement emerged during a period of trend deflation, so they likely were weary from repaying debts with deflated dollars.</strong> In a temporary victory, the movement spawned the Sherman Silver Purchase Act of 1890, which required the U.S. Treasury to buy large quantities of silver. Some economists have linked the depression that  followed the panic of 1893 to the strain that those silver purchases put on the Treasury’s gold holdings and the uncertainty they created regarding America’s commitment to the gold standard.  <strong>To allay fears of inflation, President Grover Cleveland convened a special session of Congress to quickly repeal the Sherman Silver Purchase Act, but the monetary debate continued to intensify — climaxing during the 1896 campaign.”</strong></em></div>

<div></div>
<div>When it came time for the 1896 Presidential Election, the election was essentially a national referendum on the choice between a system based on Gold vs. Gold <em><strong>and</strong> </em>Silver. This largely became known as “the currency question”.</div>
<div>
<div></div>
<div style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>“<strong>Congress responded to the depression by repealing the Sherman Act in August 1893 by a surprisingly lopsided vote.</strong> ‘The only disconsolate men in Washington last night were those who have allied themselves with the silver movement. They were prepared for defeat in the House, but not for such an overwhelming defeat.’</em></div>
<div></div>
<div style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong><em>President Cleveland was a Democrat, and the Democratic Party was largely in favor of bimetallism. Cleveland’s alliance to gold strained the party, which went on to nominate the bimetallist William Jennings Bryan for the 1896 election. Initially an underdog, Bryan won the nomination, helped by his famous <a href="http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/williamjenningsbryan1896dnc.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Cross of Gold</a> speech condemning the gold standard as a tool for the elite:</em></strong></div>
<div></div>
<div class="row embedded-image-component" style="padding-left: 40px;">
<div class="large-15 component" style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>‘. . . the question we are to decide is, upon which side will the Democratic party fight—upon the side of ‘the idle holders of idle capital,’ or upon the side of ‘the struggling masses?’ . . . There are those who believe that if you will only legislate to make the well-to-do prosperous their prosperity will leak through on those below. The Democratic idea, however, has been that if you legislate to make the masses prosperous their prosperity will find its way up through every class which rests upon them. . . . <strong>We will answer their demand for a gold standard by saying to them: You shall not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns; you shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold.’</strong></em></div>
</div>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em><strong>Bryan lost the 1896 election as the Democrats were held responsible for the depression. The gold standard soon receded as an issue and it was not a point of contention when Bryan ran four years later, primarily because gold discoveries in Canada and South Africa meant that the gold standard was boosting prices instead of restraining them.</strong>“</em></p>

<p>Can you imagine if one of your stocks paid out dividends in physical gold bars? Well that is exactly what happened with one company in the 1980s:</p>
<div class="abstract-text">
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>“Ranchers Exploration read the writing on the wall and began offering to pay dividends not in US Dollars, but in gold and silver, in part to attract shareholders to their stock.  The Dutch East India Company had regularly paid in-kind dividends to its shareholders in the 1600s and the Ranchers Development and Exploration Corp. decided to follow in their footsteps.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>The June 1981 dividend was payable in 2.5 grams of gold for every 500 shares held. Holders who owned 6,221 shares received a one-ounce gold bar.  Cash equal to $0.0766 was paid for fractional shares. The September 1981 dividend was payable in 2.5 grams for each 400 shares held.  Holders of 4,997 shares received a one-ounce bar in gold. Gold was selling at $600 an ounce on June 8, 1981 and $700 an ounce on September 24, 1981. In 1981, Ranchers Exploration had about three million shares outstanding, so the company would have paid out about 600 ounces in gold.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>In December, the company switched from gold to silver, and shareholders received a one-ounce bar of silver for every 120 shares that they owned. This would mean that the company paid out 25,000 ounces of silver to its shareholders. The March and June 1982 dividends were also payable in silver at the rate of 1 ounce of silver for each 120 shares, the September 1982 at the rate of 1 ounce of silver for each 100 shares, and the December 1982 dividend was payable in gold at the rate of 1 ounce of gold for every 4,977 shares. The 1983 dividends were payable at the rate of 1 ounce of silver for each 100 shares owned and the 1984 dividends were payable at the rate of 1 ounce of silver for each 150 shares owned.”</em></p>

<p><img alt="San Francisco Earthquake aftermath" class="aligncenter" height="730" loading="lazy" src="https://d10cq78zmnjvsx.cloudfront.net/images/investor-updates/media-items/0e97e077-0601-4c07-a373-a76b8ab38882.jpg" width="1030"/></p>
<p>In June I wrote an article about the San Francisco Earthquake and the Panic of 1907. While its limited supply is what makes gold so attractive to many investors, this scarcity is a double-edged sword. The 1906 earthquake resulted in a massive outflow of gold from London, and led to a series of knock-on effects that culminated in the Panic of 1907. This article provides a good look at why the gold standard was more problematic than we’d like to remember. Here’s an excerpt from my article:</p>
<p>“However, the impact of these payments were felt far beyond the balance sheets of these companies. The substantial payouts by British firms caused a mass outflow of gold from London as ships were loaded with gold bars for their transatlantic journey to San Francisco. By the end, Britain had outflows equal to 14% of its national gold reserves.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>“The San Francisco earthquake gave rise to a massive outflow of funds – of gold – from London. <b>In total, quake related payments to the United States represented 40 percent of seasonally adjusted British gold exports for all of 1906… These flows were nearly two-and-half times more than British gold flows to any other country in 1906</b>.”</i> <sup>2</sup></p></blockquote>
<p>Domestically, New York financial institutions were also hampered by depleted gold reserves from transfers to San Francisco. The New York Times stated “imposed a substantial drain upon the banks of [New York]”.</p>
<p><img alt="UK Gold Exports to US 1900-1913" class="content-block aligncenter" height="558" loading="lazy" src="https://d10cq78zmnjvsx.cloudfront.net/images/investor-updates/media-items/52b08673-4b9e-4753-82e6-6baf0707fcd0.png" width="886"/></p>
<p>As the Bank of England’s (BOE) ratio of reserves to deposits hit a 16 year low, there was little choice but to raise interest rates to protect its gold reserves. In September and October of 1906 the BOE raised rates 250 bps to 6.0%, which one American paper called an unexpected <i>“bombshell in the market”</i>.</p>
<p>However, American investors held no confusion over why the BOE made this decision:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>“The bank rate is now 6 per cent, the highest rate since the Baring failure sixteen years ago. <b>This step was, of course necessitated by the impoverished condition of the Bank of England [gold] reserve…</b>”</i></p></blockquote>
<p>They also recognized the negative implications this had on the US market:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>“<b>The advance in the bank rate was undoubtedly in sheer self-defense…</b> Its effect upon stock speculation must be unfavorable, and prices must fall more or less in consequence… <b>It means that there is an end coming to reckless speculation, and that nothing but liquidation of greater or less severity can restore equilibrium…</b>”</i></p></blockquote>
<p>While raising rates to 6.0%, the BOE also practically forbid British firms from accepting American ‘finance bills’, which were <i>“used to finance gold imports into the United States”</i> and provide credit. This devastated firms in the United States, and New York in particular.</p>
<blockquote><p><i>“This policy resulted in a significant fall in American securities markets, as the collateral for those bills was sold, and led to significant gold outflows from the United States. A relatively weak cotton harvest in 1907 resulted in low export revenues, further aggravating the stress on the banking system and financial markets.”</i> <sup>5</sup></p></blockquote>
<p>Remember, this all stemmed from the earthquake in April 1906. What started as a national disaster in San Francisco led to an outflow of gold in London. This forced the BOE to raise rates, which reduced American firms’ access to credit and depleted their gold reserves. This sparked widespread selling of stocks to raise cash as ‘finance bills’ came due for payment, and could not be renewed because of the BOE’s new policy.</p>

<p>The U.S. money market thus found itself “low on gold reserves and <b><i>vulnerable to shocks</i></b>”.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>“Alternative currencies, which are defined as any non-legal tender medium of exchange, have been a regular feature of the economic landscape over the last half-millennia. A survey of this history finds that alternative currencies often arise out of similar socio-economic circumstances and then cease to circulate within a relatively short time after their introduction. This pattern of decline is explained largely by three forces: regulation, technological innovation, and – most commonly – insufficient demand due to factors such as transaction inefficiencies, low institutional support, and diminished social motivation. Present-day alternative currencies, such as bitcoin and the Brixton pound, show both similarities and differences with past alternative currencies. Bitcoin in particular possesses several radical new characteristics, including a relatively decentralized structure, efficient transactions across borders, global awareness, and support from powerful institutions.”</em></p>
<p>Bitcoin is the best modern example of an alternative currency, but what have similar alternative currencies looked like over time? This article dives into the long history of alternative currencies, and the different categories that they fall into. Overall, the author argues that there are five different types of currency:</p>

<p>There are many investors that long for the days of the gold standard, but what how did the gold standard handle financial crashes and crises? This paper looks to answer that very question.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>“This paper examines the historical record of the financial crises that have often accompanied surges of globalization in the past. The issue of contagion, the spread of financial turbulence from the crisis center to its trading partners, is confronted with historical and statistical evidence on the causes and consequences of well-known crises. In general, contagion seems often confused with prior interdependence, and crises are less widespread and shorter in duration than anecdotal evidence would indicate. <strong>Special attention is given to the gold standard period of 1880-1913, which we find useful to divide into the initial period of deflation, 1880-1896, and the following period of mild inflation, 1897-1913. We find evidence of changes in the pattern of “contagion” from core to periphery countries between the two periods, but in both periods apparent contagions can more readily be interpreted as responses to common shocks.</strong> Lessons for the present period can only be tentative, but the similarities in learning experiences are striking.”</em></p>

<p>Almost two years ago to the day I wrote my first ever financial history article. I discussed Bitcoin and the concept of “intrinsic value” as it relates to currency. I’ve provided an excerpt from that article below:</p>
<p>“The currency on Yap Island, located in the Pacific, provides further evidence that the <strong>belief</strong> in a currency’s worth outweighs the importance of its intrinsic value. For centuries, the natives of Yap have used ‘rai stones’ as a form of payment and store of value. These ‘stones’, however, were actually gargantuan limestone discs weighing up to 8,800 lbs., and stood 12 feet tall. The natives ‘minted’ (mined) their currency on Palau Island, which was only reachable by boat. Upon their return from mining the currency on Palau, the Chief of Yap Island valued each rai stone in front of the entire population, where locals would then purchase the currency as part of the ceremony.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure" id="a423">The public valuation and purchasing ritual on Yap is comparable to the ‘proof of transaction’ process associated with Bitcoin. In both cases, the processes prevent fraud and theft by clearly identifying the rightful owner of each stone or token. Using a similar approach, German colonizers in the 19th century enforced their laws on the natives by publicly ‘confiscating’ dissenter’s rai stones by simply marking them with a black ‘X’.</p>
<p class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing" id="cc6f">Again, the concept of value proved to be far more significant than a stone’s intrinsic worth. In fact <span class="markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other" data-creator-ids="d167ea059d39">there is a rai stone lying on the ocean floor, after falling through a canoe, which continued to circulate in the economy. Even though the stone’s owner never physically saw their rai stone, it still carried value. In the same vein, just because Bitcoin is a digital currency that cannot be truly seen or held, the currency can still be valuable because of people’s belief in the system.”</span></p>

<p><em>“The Electric Vehicle Co. was founded in 1897 and as other electric vehicle manufacturers went bankrupt, it took over their factories. The company took control of the Motor Vehicle Co. of Elizabeth, NJ, the Pope Manufacturing Co., the Columbia Automobile Co. and the Columbia Electric Vehicle Co. of Hartford, NJ, but went into receivership on December 10, 1907. The company issued over $10 million in common stock, over $8 million in preferred and paid 8% in dividends on the common and preferred in 1899, but as profits failed to materialize, the stock price collapsed.”</em></p>

<p>I haven’t been this excited about a Sunday Reads in a while so strap in, people. It’s time for a deep dive.</p>
<p>We’re going to talk about the recent boom in electric vehicle (EV) companies, as it seems that a new EV startup is making headlines or going public via a SPAC every 3 days, and the stocks of anything even loosely related to electric vehicles are soaring. In talking about this EV boom, there are two primary themes that I want to cover: the long history of electric vehicles and investor behavior.</p>
<h4><strong>Electric Vehicles: A 19th Century Innovation</strong></h4>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-7744" height="461" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 375px) 100vw, 375px" src="https://investoramnesia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Baker-e1596833253428.jpg" srcset="https://investoramnesia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Baker-e1596833253428.jpg 824w, https://investoramnesia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Baker-e1596833253428-244x300.jpg 244w, https://investoramnesia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Baker-e1596833253428-768x944.jpg 768w" width="375"/></p>
<p>The electric vehicle is nothing new. It will come as a surprise to many readers, but <strong>the electric car was invented almost 200 years ago</strong>, in 1832. In fact, <strong>the first electric vehicle was built 50 years before the first internal combustion engine vehicle (ICEV)</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>During the 1890s, EVs outnumbered other vehicles 10-to-1, and by 1912 there were 38,842 electric vehicles on the road. </strong>I</p>
<p>n an era when America’s road system was poor and undeveloped, electric vehicles thrived as the vast majority of driving trips were short-distance, making an EV’s “range” a non-issue. However, some of the <strong>early EVs had a mileage range of 180 miles off a single charge</strong>! The picture below shows an early charging station in <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/photo-essays/2019-01-05/171-years-before-tesla-the-evolution-of-electric-vehicles" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">1912</a>:</p>

<p>At the time, internal combustion engines were also undesirable because they were physically demanding (and often dangerous) to start. Gasoline cars had to be “hand-cranked” to start, and this process was known for breaking the owner’s wrists / arms. This problem proved so pervasive, in fact, that the term “Ford Fracture” was popularized following the injuries sustained while hand-cranking early Ford models. Electric vehicles, on the other hand, were easy to start and did not require the hand-crank method. Since they were not physically demanding to start like the internal combustion car, EVs became incredibly popular for women drivers. Even Henry Ford’s wife drove an electric vehicle.</p>
<p>To really see one of these early EVs in action, watch Jay Leno drive his <strong>1909 Baker Electric, which could travel up to 100 miles on a single charge</strong>:</p>

<p>So, instead of the recent boom in electric vehicles representing a “new” alternative for internal combustion vehicles, EV’s are in the early stages of a century long comeback to reclaim their spot as the dominant vehicle. To really drive home how similar the “new” ideas in the EV industry today and those of the early 1900s are, consider the comparisons below:</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-7775" height="571" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 955px) 100vw, 955px" src="https://investoramnesia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/comp-2.png" srcset="https://investoramnesia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/comp-2.png 1311w, https://investoramnesia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/comp-2-300x179.png 300w, https://investoramnesia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/comp-2-1024x612.png 1024w, https://investoramnesia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/comp-2-768x459.png 768w" width="955"/></p>
<p>This all begs the question, what led to the original downfall of EVs? Well we’ll get to that later in the linked articles, but in <a href="https://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2010/05/the-status-quo-of-electric-cars-better-batteries-same-range.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">short</a>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">“<strong>By 1912, the gasoline car had already taken over the largest share of the automobile sales</strong> (more than 90 percent). They were <strong>faster and could drive longer distances</strong> – not only because of their better range but also because of a more elaborate refuelling infrastructure.<strong> The rapidly expanding paved road network worked in their favor, too.</strong>“</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>Internal combustion engines became much cheaper than electrics</strong>. In 1908, Ford introduced its mass-produced (and gasoline powered) <strong>Model-T, which initially sold for 850 dollars – two to three times less than the price of a similar electric vehicle. In 1912, the price of the Model-T came down to 650 dollars. That same year, the electrical starter for gasoline vehicles appeared, and took away one of the last selling points of EV’s. Last but not least, gasoline had become much cheaper than it had been at the end of the 19th century.</strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong>The only advantage left was the (potential) cleanliness and noiselessness of electric vehicles, the reason we want them back today. In 1914, Henry Ford announced the marketing of a cheap mass-produced electric vehicle, but this automobile was never produced.</strong>“</p>
<h4><strong>SPACs, Electric Vehicles &amp; Speculation</strong></h4>
<p>As a species, we are remarkably predictable. Particularly when it comes to investing. Since I began writing and posting content about financial history, I have received variations of the same question in basically every conversation, podcast appearance, etc.:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>“What are some of the specific and identifiable patterns / trends that repeat themselves in financial history?”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>While there is no shortage of suitable answers, today I want to focus on a concept that was popularized by Warren Buffett, but appears in historical sources as early as 1866: <strong>The Three I’s (Innovators, Imitators, Idiots)</strong>.</p>
<p>In a 2008 appearance on <a href="https://charlierose.com/videos/11747" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Charlie Rose</a>, the host asked Warren Buffett: <em>“Should wise people should have known better”</em> during the financial crisis? Buffett responded:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>“People always should know better. People don’t get — they don’t get smarter about things that get as basic as greed. You can’t stand to see your neighbor getting rich. You know you’re smarter than he is and he’s doing these things and he’s getting rich. And your spouse is getting unhappy with you because you aren’t doing. Pretty soon, you start doing it. </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>So you get what I call <strong>the natural progression, the three I’s, the innovators, the imitators and the idiots. </strong>Everybody just kind of goes along and you look kind of silly if you disagree. You can have these crazy Internet valuations in the late 1990’s, but they proved themselves out in the market. I mean, the next day, they were selling for more than they were the day before. And people said, you’re crazy if you don’t get in on this. It’s very human.”</em></p>
<p>As I alluded to, investors were already aware of this “Three I’s” concept back in 1866, as an issue of <em>The Economist </em>demonstrates:</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-7743 size-full" height="107" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px" src="https://investoramnesia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/three-i-2-e1596828237534.png" srcset="https://investoramnesia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/three-i-2-e1596828237534.png 426w, https://investoramnesia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/three-i-2-e1596828237534-300x75.png 300w" width="426"/></p>
<p>Kind of depressing, isn’t it? You’d think that if we knew about this Innovator -&gt; Imitator -&gt; Idiot progression in 1866, we’d have learned how to avoid it in the 21st century. Nope!</p>
<p>Today we see this with the boom in electric vehicle companies. No matter your view on Tesla or Elon Musk, there is no debating the fact that Tesla’s stock price has soared more than 300% since the middle of March. As of today’s post, the stock has returned 530% over the last year. Retail speculation and excitement surrounding Tesla has boomed this year as speculative trading became easier than ever through commission-free trading and government provided stimulus checks.</p>
<p><strong>As always, however, the next phase of speculation was increased trading in other electric vehicle companies that might be “the next Tesla”. It is no coincidence that the boom in new EV companies has coincided with the parabolic rally in Tesla’s share price. Investors who may have missed out on the Tesla trade, but saw how much other investors profited, plowed money into new EV companies like Nikola, Li Auto, Nio and others in the hopes of benefiting from a Tesla like rally. It’s the same as it ever was.</strong></p>
<p>History is riddled with examples of speculative fervor stemming from people seeing the outsized returns generated on an innovative technology or company. After missing out on the dramatic success of this innovation or stock, investors will herd into the next best option in efforts to achieve similarly outsized returns.</p>
<p>In today’s post we’ll look at a few examples of this:</p>
<ul>
<li>The 17th Century Tech Bubble in London</li>
<li>South Sea Bubble</li>
<li>British Bicycle Mania</li>
</ul>
<p>After that lengthy introduction, let’s dive in!</p>

<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7755" height="499" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 707px) 100vw, 707px" src="https://investoramnesia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Cycling-in-Hyde-Park.png" srcset="https://investoramnesia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Cycling-in-Hyde-Park.png 707w, https://investoramnesia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Cycling-in-Hyde-Park-300x212.png 300w" width="707"/></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>“Technological revolutions are often accompanied by substantial stock price reversals, but previous literature has produced competing explanations for why this is the case. This paper brings new evidence to this debate using data from the innovation-driven British Bicycle Mania of 1895-1900, in which cycle share prices rose by over 200 per cent before collapsing by more than 75 per cent. These price patterns are not fully explained by fundamentals or by changes in the nature of risk associated with cycle shares. Instead, the evidence from the Bicycle Mania supports the hypothesis of Perez (2009), who argues that new technology, high short-term profits, and loose monetary conditions increase the level of speculative investment, ‘decoupling’ share prices from fundamentals.”</em></p>
<p><strong>The Cycle Mania</strong></p>
<p><img alt="American Drivers Have Bicyclists to Thank for a Smooth Ride to ..." class="aligncenter" height="451" loading="lazy" src="https://thumbs-prod.si-cdn.com/b1cv6Z7yJ4qYBrtR1ugbe-CX5iw=/1072x720/filters:no_upscale():focal(525x158:526x159)/https://public-media.si-cdn.com/filer/3a/54/3a541152-f758-420f-9b6a-6bd0c3276765/the_american_velocipede-wr.jpg" width="671"/></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>“The growth of the cycle industry between 1895 and 1900 had its origins in a series of technological innovations. The ‘safety’ design, diamond frame, and pneumatic tire made for a much more comfortable ride, and the use of ball bearings and new processes for producing weldless steel tubes substantially increased British productive capacity. The widespread adoption of the pneumatic tire in 1895 resulted in a rapid increase in demand for bicycles, which existing producers struggled to meet. There was thus a rapid increase in the number of registered cycle manufacturers in Britain: Harrison reports a fourfold increase between 1889 and 1897, with the majority based in the West Midlands. Rubinstein estimates that at the height of the boom in 1896, 750,000 bicycles were produced per year, and 1.5 million people cycled, at a time when the population of Britain was around 35 million.”</em></p>
<p>In April 1896 a British newspaper argued that <strong>“cycle shares promise to become as inflated as the tires”</strong>. There was ample reason for such a statement, as the table below exhibits how many new cycle companies were being floated at the time of Cycle Mania.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-7754" height="398" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 638px) 100vw, 638px" src="https://investoramnesia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/cycle-cos.png" srcset="https://investoramnesia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/cycle-cos.png 1160w, https://investoramnesia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/cycle-cos-300x187.png 300w, https://investoramnesia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/cycle-cos-1024x639.png 1024w, https://investoramnesia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/cycle-cos-768x479.png 768w" width="638"/></em></p>
<p>Again, we see the recognizable pattern of companies forming following a dramatic rise in shares of stocks related to a new technology:</p>

<p>While the the author of this article, Dr. Andrew Odlyzko, points out that the story is probably apocryphal, one of the most repeated stories of the South Sea Bubble was the promotion of a company that <strong>“lured investors into putting money into “an undertaking of great advantage, but nobody to know what it is’.”</strong>As Odlyzko notes, however, even if that specific anecdote is apocryphal there were equally ludicrous examples of investors blindly investing their money while chasing returns. For example, while the South Sea Company gets all of the focus for it’s dramatic rise, <a href="https://www.ssrn.com/abstract=1371007" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">William Goetzmann and his co-authors</a> demonstrate just how parabolic the returns in another exciting new industry were at the same time:<strong> Insurance firms</strong>.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-7751" height="538" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 548px) 100vw, 548px" src="https://investoramnesia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Insurance-returns.png" srcset="https://investoramnesia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Insurance-returns.png 740w, https://investoramnesia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Insurance-returns-300x294.png 300w" width="548"/></p>
<p>Is it any wonder, then, that while Insurance firms were generating enormous returns in the stock market that investors succumbed to the schemed described in this article?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>“Starting on Friday, December 18, 1719, the<strong> Daily Post carried for several days an ad for an ‘extraordinary scheme for a new insurance company to be proposed, </strong>(whereof publick notice will speedily be given in this paper)<strong>,’</strong> <strong>with ‘permits to subscribe’ offered for £0.05 each. No names of projectors, nor details of the scheme were cited.</strong> </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>The sale of the ‘permits’ took place on Thursday, December 24. <strong>Two days later, this same paper had an ad which offered refunds for the ‘several hundred’ of those permits that had been sold and explained that the whole thing was a hoax designed to show how easy it was to ‘impose upon a credulous multitude’</strong>.”</em></p>
<p>As expected, the South Sea Bubble of 1720 offered a perfect example of how investors will herd into newly formed companies following the outsized success of a particular stock in the hopes that they will “hit the lottery” and experience a similar rally.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>“<strong>The ebullient atmosphere of 1719 offered new opportunities to promoters, and they began soliciting money from investors</strong>. Figure 1 </em>[below]<em> shows, in the scatter plot, the number of new projects announced each month, but multiplied by 10, so that the 88 projects of June 1720 correspond to 880 in the figure. These numbers are taken from William Scott’s The Constitution and Finance of English, Scottish and Irish Joint-stock Companies to 1720. <strong>As can be seen, out of the almost 200 projects that Scott tabulated, only 13 were started in 1719. But they were noticed by many observers. Also noticed was what seemed to many skeptics to be the inordinate credulity of the public that was eager to get involved.</strong> This led to the first of the events that likely inspired the ‘undertaking of great advantage, but nobody to know what it is’ fable.”</em></p>

As the poet and projector, Aaron Hill, commented on Phips’s expedition, “never sure were nay men of common sense embarked in a more unpromising adventure; ’twas above a million to one against them”, but through its spectacular success “a thousand families have been since undone, by sending their estates a diving after shipwrecked treasure”. Five patents had been issued for diving engines between 1672 and 1689; 17 petitions were filed between the autumn of 1691 and late 1693, of which 11 were enrolled. Alone they accounted for almost one-fifth of all patents issued in 1691-3.”</em></p>

<p>An excellent overview of the EV industry’s early years:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>“The dawn of commercialization of electric vehicles is upon us. Nevertheless it is very interesting to note that commercialization of electric vehicles was in fact successful in the early 20th century. This paper scans our past in the research, development, and commercialization of electric vehicles commencing from their invention in 1828 until their almost nonexistence in 1930. Their features in the technology development, production from small scale to commercial scale, applications from private users to commercial ones, and the corresponding charging infrastructure and business model are all analyzed and compared with the present development. Therefore, lessons can be learned from history to speed up our present development and avoid the same mistakes as in the past.”</em></p>

<p>This paper takes a deeper look at the explosion in patents related to seawater diving following the massive success of William Phips treasure hunt.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>“<strong>Speculation had already been fueled by the unusually profitable wreck-fishing expeditions of Captain William Phips to the Caribbean in 1685 and 1687, which raised hopes of instant wealth from a small investment…</strong></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em><strong>The diving-engine with its attendant wreck-fishing expedition was the epitome of 169os projecting. Intense excitement had been generated in the late 168os by Phips’s lucrative treasure hunts in the West Indies. The relative failure of several subsequent expeditions dampened hopes, but prospective investors could be assured of success by the use of a patented diving bell or suit that would allow its occupant to stay underwater longer than ever before.</strong> As the poet and projector, Aaron Hill, commented on Phips’s expedition, ‘never sure were nay men of common sense embarked in a more unpromising adventure; ’twas above a million to one against them’, but through its spectacular success ‘<strong>a thousand families have been since undone, by sending their estates a diving after shipwrecked treasure’</strong>. </em></p>
<p>The fervor for new technology and rampant speculation at the time is demonstrated by the increase in patents overall during this period, but “diving engine” patents specifically:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>“<strong>Five patents had been issued for diving engines between 1672 and 1689; 17 petitions were filed between the autumn of 1691 and late 1693, of which 11 were enrolled</strong>. Alone they accounted for almost one-fifth of all patents issued in 1691-3… Some of the engines seem to have served their purpose, but <strong>there is no record of any repetition of Phips’s success</strong>.”</em></p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-7760" height="145" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 836px) 100vw, 836px" src="https://investoramnesia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Patent-increase.png" srcset="https://investoramnesia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Patent-increase.png 1188w, https://investoramnesia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Patent-increase-300x52.png 300w, https://investoramnesia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Patent-increase-1024x177.png 1024w, https://investoramnesia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Patent-increase-768x133.png 768w" width="836"/></p>
<p>As expected, the plethora of imitator companies were unable to replicate the success of William Phip’s success, despite the patent boom and excitement for diving technology companies.</p>

<p>I do not think that there is a better description for what markets are like today than this excerpt from an article written over a century ago in 1890:</p>
<p><img alt="Image" class="aligncenter" height="168" loading="lazy" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EeI3V2-XoAEJ3vy?format=jpg&amp;name=900x900" width="378"/></p>
<p>The events and headlines of this week feel like a microcosm of financial markets for the last decade, and certainly the last 7 months. There was a congressional anti-trust hearing with four of the big tech companies that have powered markets higher, Robinhood traders and retail speculators found a newly beloved stock in Kodak, and GDP data again reminded us  just how detrimental COVID-19 has been to the economy.</p>
<p><strong>Big Tech</strong></p>
<p>Big Tech has been a dominant force for the last decade in a myriad of ways. In the stock market, the so called FAANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google) have powered major indices like the S&amp;P 500 to new highs, and have seemed unstoppable at times. Just look at the chart below comparing returns of FAANG stocks, the S&amp;P 500, and the S&amp;P 500 Ex-FAANG:</p>
<p><img alt="Image" class="aligncenter" height="338" loading="lazy" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EeIeCS_VAAAcyd-?format=jpg&amp;name=4096x4096" width="648"/></p>
<p>These mega cap tech names have played such a key part in driving markets higher that many investors have become increasingly concerned about their dominance in major indices like the S&amp;P 500, where FAANGM (including Microsoft) stocks represent 25% of the index’s market capitalization. This begs the question, what has market concentration at the top looked like throughout history? This chart provides a helpful <a href="https://us.dimensional.com/perspectives/large-and-in-charge-giant-firms-atop-the-market-is-nothing-new" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">summary</a>:</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-7726" height="347" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 795px) 100vw, 795px" src="https://investoramnesia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DFA-Top-Stocks-Weighting-Since-1927-1.png" srcset="https://investoramnesia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DFA-Top-Stocks-Weighting-Since-1927-1.png 1251w, https://investoramnesia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DFA-Top-Stocks-Weighting-Since-1927-1-300x131.png 300w, https://investoramnesia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DFA-Top-Stocks-Weighting-Since-1927-1-1024x447.png 1024w, https://investoramnesia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/DFA-Top-Stocks-Weighting-Since-1927-1-768x335.png 768w" width="795"/></p>
<p>Outside of markets, however, these companies have also played a major role in our personal lives. Whether it’s the line items for Amazon purchases that show up on our bank statements, using Google to answer all of our questions, or the dominance of Facebook / Twitter in the weekly screen-time reports provided on our Apple iPhones, it’s hard to escape big tech.</p>
<p>For the House Judiciary committee’s antitrust subcommittee, that could be a problem.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, four of these big tech companies were summoned for a congressional anti-trust hearing in which the chairman of the antitrust subcommittee set the day’s tone by opening with <em>“Our founders would not bow before a king. Nor should we bow before the emperors of the online economy.”</em>  Lawmakers repeatedly accused the leaders of Facebook, Amazon, Google, and Apple of engaging in anti-competitive and monopolistic practices that pose a threat to free markets.</p>
<p>Many of the articles in today’s post will look at the history of technology and stock markets, but more importantly the role of anti-trust and regulation.</p>
<p><strong>Kodak and Speculation</strong></p>
<p>This week perfectly summarized why markets in 2020 are so bizarre. On the one hand, we received awful GDP <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-30/u-s-economy-shrinks-at-record-32-9-pace-in-second-quarter?srnd=premium" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">numbers</a>:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>“<strong>The U.S. economy suffered its sharpest downturn since at least the 1940s in the second quarter</strong>, highlighting how the pandemic has ravaged businesses across the country and left millions of Americans out of work. </em><em><strong>Gross domestic product shrank 9.5% in the second quarter from the first, a drop that equals an annualized pace of 32.9%, the Commerce Department’s initial estimate showed on Thursday. That’s the steepest annualized decline in quarterly records dating back to 1947 and compares with analyst estimates for a 34.5% contraction</strong>.”</em></p>
<p><img alt="U.S. GDP plunged 32.9% in the second quarter amid virus-induced shutdown" class="aligncenter" height="294" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ie8_aY1YfgIo/v4/-1x-1.png" width="523"/></p>
<p>On the other hand, unabated speculation from retail investors continued in random stocks like Eastman Kodak, the 132-year-old photography-turned-cryptocurrency-turned-bankrupt-turned-pharmaceutical-company. At one point during the week, shares of Kodak were up an astonishing 2,760%. Why, you may rightly ask? As <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-28/kodak-gets-765m-u-s-loan-to-make-drug-ingredients-dj-reports" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a> describes it:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>“<strong>Eastman Kodak Co. shares more than tripled Tuesday on a $765 million government loan to help produce ingredients used in key generic medicines to fight the coronavirus.</strong></em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>The development bank loan is the first of its kind under the Defense Production Act in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Defense. It’s intended to speed production of drugs in short supply and those considered critical to treat Covid-19, including hydroxychloroquine, the controversial antimalarial drug touted by President Donald Trump.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>The money could provide a lifeline to Kodak, the storied photography giant whose business and shares were devastated by the switch to filmless cameras. Once a stalwart of American industry with a market capitalization above $30 billion, the company declared bankruptcy in 2012, forcing it into a series of attempted reinventions including forays into printers, film for movies and, briefly, cryptocurrencies.”</em></p>
<p>And yes, you can probably imagine what I am going to say next… Robinhood traders <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-29/kodak-stock-surge-attracks-43-000-robinhood-traders-in-24-hours" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">loved this</a>!</p>
<p><em>“As of 3:30 p.m. in New York on Wednesday, <strong>almost 79,000 users of the investing app had added Kodak to their accounts in some form over the past 24 hours, according to website Robintrack.net, which aggregates data from the brokerage but isn’t affiliated with it. The activity was 15 times more than the next most-popular stock</strong>, Heat Biologics Inc. Roughly 34,000 of the additions came over the latest four-hour span.”</em></p>
<p><img alt="relates to Robinhood Daytraders Stampede Into Kodak as Stock Soars" class="aligncenter" height="223" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/ilno6PMMRcPM/v0/800x-1.png" width="439"/></p>
<p>It’s a weird time to be an investor, that is for sure.</p>
<p>While the Kodak story is crazy and one of the articles in today’s post will look at the company’s storied history, the majority of today’s links will focus on the primary story of the week: Big Tech Regulation and Anti-Trust. Let’s get to it!</p>

<p>On the day of the congressional hearing this week, CNBC displayed the stock prices of all four companies in order to gauge investor’s real time sentiments about the prospects of each company ahead of their appearances before congress. In that same vein, this paper looks at how investors reacted to anti-trust news and enforcement in the early 20th century.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-7719" height="388" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 637px) 100vw, 637px" src="https://investoramnesia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dow.png" srcset="https://investoramnesia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dow.png 980w, https://investoramnesia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dow-300x183.png 300w, https://investoramnesia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Dow-768x468.png 768w" width="637"/></p>
<p>Like CNBC on Wednesday, the paper even provides the daily returns on days where major events related to anti-trust occurred. For example, we can see that on the day that the Standard Oil investigation was announced, the Dow Jones fell -1.89%. The worst daily decline in the table below, however, was after President Roosevelt issued a directive to the Interstate Commerce Commission to investigate the railroads on March 14th. On that day, the Dow Jones fell -8.65%.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-7718" height="476" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 454px) 100vw, 454px" src="https://investoramnesia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Events-e1596300422758.png" srcset="https://investoramnesia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Events-e1596300422758.png 604w, https://investoramnesia.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Events-e1596300422758-286x300.png 286w" width="454"/></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>“The turn-of-the-century struggle over trusts and corporations gave birth to industrial economics. In fact, that era’s hotly debated questions—predation, merger, vertical restrictions, federal incorporation, and patent licensing—have an eerie familiarity. But one topic has never been followed up: did trust-busting hurt the stock market, as many critics claimed at the time? </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>At one level, the answer is clear. Filing suits against large corporations and threatening to break them up and force changes in the way they do business is bound to lower their value. The stock prices of actual defendants, likely targets, and firms whose business plans or hopes of merger are spoiled should all drop. The idea also has a stellar endorsement: Irving Fisher chalked up the boom market of the 1920s to restrained antitrust.1 But today the notion seems bold, bizarre, and obviously false. To many economists, antitrust is a sometimes misguided but basically sound and minor part of government economic policy. </em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>The statistical work in this article links federal antitrust filings and ten stock-price indexes over the period 1904-14, from the revival of antitrust under Teddy Roosevelt to the passage of the Clayton Act and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Act. My strategy is to exploit the instability of enforcement in the intervening years, an instability that seems to have been generated by the volatile politics of the trust question.”</em></p>

<p>The Big Tech hearings this week on anti-trust / monopolies sparked comparisons with the breakup of Standard Oil, and many argued that “data is the new oil”. If data is in fact the new oil, then <a href="http://www.globalfinancialdata.com/gfd-finaeon-overview/">Global Financial Data</a> is the John D. Rockefeller of financial history, with financial data stretching back over 1,000 years.</p>
<p>This article is interesting for two reasons. First, as clearly demonstrated by the chart from earlier in today’s post that compared returns for <strong><em>FAANG Stocks</em></strong> and the <strong><em>S&amp;P 500 Ex-FAANG</em></strong>, an index’s returns can be heavily influenced by just a few stocks. Using their extensive data on historical returns for individual stocks, GFD was able to study how just <strong><em>one</em></strong> stock may impact an index (or <em>not</em>, in this example).</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>“<strong>One of the long-term components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average has been IBM. The company was originally added to the Dow Jones Industrials on March 26, 1932</strong> in a reshuffle involving eight stocks including Coca-Cola, Nash Motors (later American Motors) and Proctor &amp; Gamble. <strong>On March 13, 1939, however, both IBM and Nash Motors were removed from the average and replaced by American Telephone &amp; Telegraph and United Aircraft Corp</strong>. (now United Technologies).</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong><em>AT&amp;T was in the Dow Jones Utilities Average until June 1, 1938. Until then, the Dow committee had interpreted utilities in a broader sense to include electric, gas, and communications companies as providers of essential services. In 1938, the Dow Jones committee decided to restrict membership in the Utilities Average to power utilities.</em></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>The resulting reshuffle removed nine stocks, including AT&amp;T, International Telephone &amp; Telegraph, and Western Union, all of which were communications utilities rather than power utilities, from the Dow Jones Utilities Average<strong>. Since AT&amp;T was such a huge company, it was moved over to the Dow Jones Industrial Average which required that another stock be removed to make room for AT&amp;T. Thus, IBM was kicked out of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.</strong>”</em></p>
<p>To summarize, changes to the Dow Jones Utilities Average requirements kicked out AT&amp;T. Since it was such a large company, and now suddenly eligible for the Dow Jones <em>Industrial</em> Average, IBM was booted from the DJIA in order to substitute in AT&amp;T. Well, we’ve seen how much of an influence 5 FAANG stocks can have on the S&amp;P 500’s returns, but what was the impact of a <strong><em>single</em></strong> stock, replacing IBM with AT&amp;T?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>“<strong>What if IBM had stayed in the Dow Jones Industrial Average between March 13, 1939 when it was removed and June 29, 1979 when IBM replaced Chrysler in the Dow Jones Industrials?</strong> Obviously, the Dow Jones Industrials would be higher than it is today, but how much higher?</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong><em>… IBM has been one of the best performers on the stock exchange in history. If you had invested $1 in IBM when it started trading OTC in August 1911, it would have grown to $40,000 today on a price basis. If you had reinvested your dividends, your $1 investment would have grown to $1,434,300<span style="color: #000000;">.</span></em></strong><em> In the past 100 years, IBM has given over a million-fold return…</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong><em>AT&amp;T incorporated in New York on March 3, 1885 and began trading on the NYSE in May 1900 after it had acquired American Bell Telephone Co. in March 1900. The company was forced to split up into “Ma Bell” and the “Baby Bells” by the U.S. Government on December 31, 1983.</em></strong><em> On November 18, 2005, AT&amp;T Corp. (“Ma Bell”) was acquired by one of the Baby Bells, SBC Communications, which then changed its name to AT&amp;T Inc. in a reverse acquisition.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong><em>AT&amp;T has not performed as well as IBM over the past 100 years. If you had invested $1 in AT&amp;T in May 1900, your investment would have grown to only $4.26 on a price basis, or $639 if you had reinvested all of your dividends back in the company, by the time AT&amp;T was broken up in February 1984.</em></strong></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><strong><em>So what if the Dow Jones Committee had kept IBM in the Dow Jones Average between March 1939 and June 1979 and had never admitted AT&amp;T, keeping it in the Utilities Average? What would the result have been?</em></strong><em>… The DJIA stood at 151.1 on March 14, 1939 and 841.98 on June 29, 1979. Since the DJIA is price weighted, you can remove the impact of AT&amp;T on the DJIA by subtracting out the price of AT&amp;T allowing for the splits, and replacing this amount with the value of IBM stock, allowing for the splits in IBM. If you do this, you would find <strong>that the DJIA would have been at 23,582 in June 1979, not 841.98. In other words, IBM would have added 22,740 points to the DJIA had it never been removed.”</strong></em></p>
<p>So, a pretty big impact, right? This brings me to the second reason why this article is interesting and relevant: <strong>innovation and competition</strong>.</p>

<p>Global Financial Data’s long-term returns for IBM clearly show that the stock was a power-house, and more generally, IBM was once a leading technology company that was considered forward-thinking and innovative. In the company’s more recent history, however, “Big Blue” has lagged behind while other tech giants have dominated. While it is a complicated issue, I think that IBM is an example of how a company that can appear unassailable, can be disrupted by other innovators. Just as it’s hard for any of us to imagine a scenario where Amazon isn’t dominating the world, many would have said the same thing about Sears. Food for thought.</p>

<p>While the innovations and technological advancements of modern big tech companies are new, this relationship between “technological revolutions” and stock prices is not. This article looks at the railroad industry of the 19th century, and compares it with the internet boom over a century later.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>“We develop a general equilibrium model in which stock prices of innovative firms exhibit “bubbles” during technological revolutions. <strong>In the model, the average productivity of a new technology is uncertain and subject to learning. During technological revolutions, the nature of this uncertainty changes from idiosyncratic to systematic. The resulting “bubbles” in stock prices are observable ex post but unpredictable ex ante, and they are most pronounced for technologies characterized by high uncertainty and fast adoption.</strong> We find empirical support for the model’s predictions in 1830–1861 and 1992–2005 when the railroad and Internet technologies spread in the United States.”</em></p>

<p><strong>READ. THIS. ARTICLE. </strong></p>
<p>It is absolutely fascinating, and embodies many of the major arguments / themes repeated throughout the hearing on Wednesday by looking at the Standard Oil case of 1911, and its implications for Google (and Big Tech generally) today. Here is an excerpt, which is lengthy, but so good:</p>
<p><em>“A number of observers have been sounding the alarm recently about the growth of monopoly power in the US economy. Expressions of concern have issued from all parts of the political spectrum, but the most sustained warnings have come from the self-proclaimed “New Brandeisians,” a group of scholars for whom the title of Louis Brandeis’s famous essay, “A Curse of Bigness”, has become a potent rallying cry. Members of this group claim that Google, Amazon, and other giant tech firms are exploiting blatantly anti-competitive practices to block potential rivals—and getting away with it by manipulating the political system. They are particularly worried that current antitrust orthodoxy, which is preoccupied with the issue of harms to consumers, has left the country all but defenseless against bigness’s other ills.</em></p>
<p><em>The New Brandeisians argue that the country has entered a second Gilded Age, and certainly the concerns they express are much the same as those prompted by the rise of the Standard Oil Trust in that earlier period of turmoil. To late nineteenth-century Americans, Standard was a monster that corrupted politicians and laid waste its competitors. Legislators responded to the mounting pressure to take action by passing antitrust laws at both the state and federal levels beginning in the late 1880s, but these statutes did not prevent other large firms from amassing positions of dominance in most important sectors of the economy over the next two decades. Some of the new giants followed Standard’s example and achieved their market power by acquiring competitors. Others grew large by innovating, devising new products or new ways of producing that yielded significant economies of scale. Regardless of the route these firms took to bigness, their sheer size and sudden emergence awoke fears that, unless the government did something fast to prevent it, the giants would entrench themselves by nefarious means. </em></p>
<p><em>There was general agreement that Standard had grown large by pursuing anti-competitive practices and should be broken up, and in 1911 the US Supreme Court issued the necessary order. The knottier problem was how to deal with “trusts” (as big businesses were generically called) that acquired their market power by innovating. Although contemporaries tried, following President Theodore Roosevelt’s lead, to sort the trusts into “good” and “bad” categories, this exercise in classification turned out to have severe limitations. Because firms always pursue a mix of strategies to “escape from equilibrium,” in Levenstein’s apt phrase, deciding which behaviors were pro- and which were anti-competitive was a difficult task. Not only did “good” trusts sometimes resort to “bad” practices to preserve their advantages, but there were many cases in which it was not at all easy to distinguish actions that were anti-competitive in their purpose and effect from those that improved productivity and brought real benefits to consumers. During the so-called Progressive Period—that is, from the turn of the twentieth century to the outbreak of First World War—policymakers struggled with this problem. The solution they arrived at was to write a set of specific prohibitions into the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914 and simultaneously to create a new regulatory agency, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), empowered to define and police the boundary. </em></p>
<p><em>The boundary between anti-competitive practices and those that enhanced efficiency nonetheless remained difficult to draw. Firms continuously sought new ways to increase their market power, and regulators just as continuously sought new ways to make their efforts illegal. The line between behaviors seen as violating the law and those viewed as legally acceptable shifted back and forth; regulators were excessively vigilant in some periods and excessively lax in others. During the late 1930s, however, in the context of a revival of anti–big business sentiment during the late New Deal, antitrust officials abandoned the attempt to draw the line and instead defined bigness itself as the problem. Their success in inducing the courts to impose antitrust remedies on firms that had not been found guilty of anti-competitive conduct provoked a counter-reaction by a group of economic and legal scholars, dubbed the “Chicago School,” who in turn prevailed in the courts once economic conditions deteriorated in the 1970s. Advocates of the Chicago School sought to shift the focus of inquiry from whether large firms had market power to whether the market power they possessed had been detrimental to consumers. Like the aggressive trust-busters they opposed, however, they emphatically rejected the preoccupation with conduct that early twentieth-century policymakers had built into the law—just in time for a new wave of giant innovative firms to behave in ways that reanimated those very concerns.”</em></p>

<p>There is no way that I could ignore the absolute insanity that was Kodak’s stock price this week…</p>
</div>
<p>While everyone is talking about Kodak today, many are unaware of just how old the company truly is, stretching back to the 19th century. The company’s origins are truly impressive, and this article does an excellent job documenting the life of the founder: George Eastman.</p>
<div class="abstract-text">
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>“The technologies of today are built upon those of the past, and the superstars of our era would be nothing without the great leaders of the past. We often discuss our favorite “tech” entrepreneurs. Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Elon Musk, and many other names arise. Too often these discussions lack historical perspective. Here we build a case for George Eastman as the greatest technology entrepreneur. Why does he deserve such a high ranking?</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>George Eastman, or “GE” as he was called most of his life, was born to a reasonably prosperous family, but his father died in 1862 when the boy was seven years old, forcing his mother to fend for herself and her three children. He became interested in the emerging field of photography and went on to “father” amateur photography with his Kodak cameras and film. Under his leadership, his Eastman Kodak company became a global powerhouse, perhaps still unequaled in its global reach and dominance of an important field.</em></p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>The company’s innovations led to mass consumer photography, aerial photography, medical x-rays, and the development of the movie industry, precursors to today’s selfies and even YouTube. Eastman was the “total entrepreneur”—marketing genius, financial wizard, great employer, both a visionary and a hands-on inventor and designer. Over the years, he became one of the most important philanthropists in American history, perhaps foreshadowing Bill Gates’s diverse interests. Above all else, George Eastman was “his own man”—a unique personality of independent mind. This is his story.”</em></p>
